<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p id="p1" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p1">The majority of the papers in this handbook document how to create Linked Open Data (LOD) for specific types of ancient and medieval data, e.g. chronology, prosopography, geography, numismatics, text corpora, codicology, or 3D environments. This paper describes how these individual applications of LOD can be combined in order to digitally model the history of particular communities and their cultural heritage information (CHI). Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal offers a case study for how one project has linked together multiple entity classes (data about persons, places, primary source texts, bibliographic citations, manuscripts, and topics) into a digital knowledge graph for a specific field of cultural heritage research, the discipline of Syriac Studies. </p>

<p id="p2" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p2">Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic which was used widely by a number of communities in the Middle East and Asia during the first millennium of the current era. In the past quarter-century, the academic study of Syriac literature and cultures has grown dynamically. Historical information from Syriac sources is now recognized as relevant to a variety of academic fields including Middle Eastern Studies, Classics, Medieval History, Religious Studies, and Linguistics. In addition, the history of the Syriac language and culture is an essential part of the identity of a number of ethnic and religious heritage communities around the globe. This growth of Syriac Studies has occurred at the same time as research in ancient and medieval history has turned toward digital approaches for modelling and publishing historical data such as those described in this volume. Situated at the intersection of these two scholarly developments, Syriaca.org is a collaborative project to build a Linked Open Data model (a knowledge graph) for core concepts in the field of Syriac Studies. Syriaca.org has applied the principles of LOD to aggregate, relate, and publish historical data drawn from Syriac sources, integrating this data with the growing “Web of Data”, the cloud of Linked Data on the Web. This paper presents the research questions and disciplinary approaches which have informed the Syriaca.org data model. It also describes the technical methods used to implement this model in digital format. While Syriaca.org’s knowledge graph was conceived in response to the unique needs of the field of Syriac Studies, its general design offers a case study for how historians in other fields can use Linked Open Data to digitally model cultural heritage information.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p id="p3" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p3">This paper proceeds in two parts in order to describe the scholarly aims and data structures which shaped the digital publications of Syriaca.org. The bulk of the paper surveys the state of Syriac Studies as a field of research, noting both representative research questions and identifying some of the perceived needs which define the scholarly purposes of Syriaca.org. This section summarizes the research aims of the Syriaca.org reference project: to compile core data related to Syriac sources into authority files, to establish standard vocabularies and best practices for encoding and aggregating data related to these authority files, and to foster collaboration in the creation of a digital knowledge graph for the field of Syriac Studies. These intellectual goals guide the specific ways Syriaca.org has employed Linked Data technologies for the discovery and modelling of historical information related to a particular group of cultural heritage communities.</p>

<p id="p4" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p4">The second half of the paper is a technical description of the Syriaca.org knowledge graph. The graph is a digital model of historical information, a research tool useful to specialists and non-specialists alike. Both the individual data points in the graph and the network of relationships between them can be queried and analyzed.  For some research questions, the graph as a whole is more valuable than individual parts. The Linked Data structure of the Syriaca.org knowledge graph is intentionally designed to facilitate searches across the graph which may not have been anticipated by the scholars who encoded any individual poin of data. Following the principles of Linked Data, Syriaca.org has structured its data around six classes of historical entities: persons, places, primary source texts, scholarly bibliographic citations, manuscripts, and keyword classifications.  Additional classes of entity are planned for the future, including a seventh class for material artifacts (tangible cultural heritage). Through the use of common Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies and open access data licenses, Syriaca.org is able to aggregate its data with the growing cloud of Linked Open (Historical) Data (a part of the larger Web of Data).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> In the Syriaca.org data model, this LOD dataset is a final product rather than the base data format. Because best practices and common vocabularies for the use of RDF in historical research are still emerging, Syriaca.org does not use RDF as the native format for data. Instead, RDF data is serialized (e.g. generated) out of individual XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data files for each entity encoded according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). TEI XML is an encoding scheme which pre-dates the RDF format and is ideally suited to humanistic and historical textual data. The use of TEI XML as a base data format allows the Syriaca.org dataset to adhere to scholarly standards for data provenance and source citation, as well as preserving some of the ambiguities of data derived from ancient and medieval texts. The end result is a data model which combines the advantages of a Linked Open Data knowledge graph with the textual nuance of the TEI standards.</p>

<h2>Syriac Studies in a Digital Age</h2>

<p id="p5" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p5">Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic once spoken across the Middle East and Asia. For much of the first millennium C.E., Syriac served as a <i>lingua franca</i> used in travel, trade, and religious culture from the Eastern coast of the Mediterranean to beyond the Iranian plateau. Even after the Arabization of the Middle East, Syriac literature and networks of Syriac-speaking scholars served as a cultural bridge between the Greek world of Byzantium and the Arab courts of the Islamic states. Today, Syriac heritage communities can be found in the Middle East, India and in a global diaspora. In addition to the contemporary use of the Syriac language, perhaps more than twenty-thousand historical manuscripts or manuscript fragments written in Classical Syriac survive, with a wide range in geographic provenance stretching from Syria, the Levant, and Egypt to Iraq, Iran, western China and South India.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> Some of these manuscripts are over 1500 years old and many are unique sources for documenting Middle Eastern and Asian history. These Syriac materials provide windows into political and cultural history of the region from the upheavals of the Roman Empire through the end of Ottoman rule and into the tumults of the modern Middle East. Syriac sources also document key moments in the development of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These materials are of interest both to cultural heritage communities and to scholars in a variety of disciplines including Middle Eastern Studies, Classics, Medieval History, Religious Studies, and Linguistics.</p>


<section id="section2.1">

<h3>Fundamental Research Questions</h3>

<p id="p6" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p6">As a field of research, Syriac Studies has a long history.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> Since the time of the second-century Syriac author Bardaisan, Syriac authors have had a robust intellectual engagement with their own literary and cultural heritage, a scholarly tradition which continues to flourish in the present among the Syriac ecclesiastical communities as well as in a Syriac cultural diaspora around the globe.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> In Europe, critical scholarship on Syriac sources can be traced to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when European scholars began to regularly encounter scholars from the Syriac traditions.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> As the modern research university came into being in the nineteenth century, Syriac was one of the subjects regularly taught at universities in Berlin, Paris, Oxford, and the United States.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> In spite of this long pedigree, it must be noted that in these academic contexts Syriac Studies was usually viewed as an auxiliary field of study, its presence justified as an adjunct to other fields such as Biblical Studies or Arabic literature rather than for its own intrinsic value.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> It is only in the last quarter-century that the field of Syriac Studies has seen dramatic growth as a field in its own right. A keyword search for “Syriac” in the titles or abstracts of anglophone dissertations in the <i>ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Database</i> reveals 345 Ph.D. theses related to Syriac between 1902 and 2020. Of these, half (179) were completed since the year 2000.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup> This growth has brought the field up from negligible numbers to a critical mass of scholars, opening greater possibilities for collaborative projects and increasing demand for updated reference works that reflect recent advances in the field.</p>

<p id="p7" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p7">In his <i>Introduction to Syriac Studies</i>, revised in 2017, Sebastian Brock notes six areas of research that have motivated the majority of scholarship on Syriac literature and culture.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> Because the Syriaca.org knowledge graph is built on the fruits of this previous scholarship, it is worth surveying representative research questions from these six areas. A design principle of Syriaca.org is to facilitate these existing lines of research while also creating a flexible data model that will not foreclose new directions of research. </p>

<p id="p8" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p8">As already noted, the development of Syriac Studies has often been as an auxiliary part of larger fields of inquiry. Four of the six areas identified by Brock fall in this category and share a common pattern of research questions.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> The first area is the field of Biblical Studies which has sustained a long research interest in Syriac versions of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament with an aim to understanding the relationships of the multiple Syriac Bible translations to each other and to their <i>Vorlagen</i> in Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew. Questions of provenance have led scholars to research textual versions, manuscripts, scribes, translators, sponsors, and commentators across a wide geographical region. Where did the Syriac Bible versions originate? What sources did they use? What theological influences shaped their translations? Who funded Bible production? What manuscripts have survived, and where were they copied, preserved, or read? In the Syriaca.org knowledge graph these relationships are mapped conceptually as a network of texts, manuscripts, persons, places, and themes. These same concepts are also relevant to a second group, scholars of the history of Christianity who have shown increasing interest in Christian texts from Late Antiquity, both those written in Syriac and Greek texts preserved in Syriac translation. Their research questions are concerned with recovering Greek original texts from the Syriac translations and also with tracing the reception history of ancient and medieval theological themes in Syriac literature.</p>

<p id="p9" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p9">While much of the surviving Syriac literature is Christian in origin, its historical import for the field of Religious Studies is broader given its geographic and cultural proximity to both Judaism and Islam.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-12" href="#footnote-12">12</a></sup> Scholars interested in the interaction of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are often interested in questions of the transmission and influence of ideas and texts across religious and linguistic traditions. What Christian texts were known by early Islamic scholars? Did Syriac biblical commentators know of Rabbinic commentary? Which texts were available to particular readers? Perhaps most attention has been given to the transmission of ancient Greek philosophy and medicine to the Islamic world through the work of Syriac translators. As Brock notes, however, research on Syriac as a bridge culture is much more than the meeting of Byzantium and Islam: “It was, however, not only into Arabic that translations from Syriac were made: by the end of the first millennium AD works in Syriac had found their way into languages as diverse as Greek, Armenian, Georgian, Middle Persian, Sogdian, Coptic, and Ethiopic.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-13" href="#footnote-13">13</a></sup> As in Biblical Studies and scholarship on early Christianity, scholars studying Syriac cultural encounters in the context of religious studies have focused on questions of manuscript provenance, authorship, textual identification, transmission of themes and ideas, and geographic dissemination.</p>

<p id="p10" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p10">The fourth research area highlighted by Brock is the relevance of Syriac Studies to the study of Christian liturgy. He notes the long-standing effort of comparative liturgists to reconstruct early Christian rites through comparison of Syriac versions with Latin and Greek counterparts. Here the same questions of transmission are foundational to research. Beyond recovery of proto-Christian <i>Urtexten</i>, however, Brock also notes the richness of the medieval Syriac liturgical tradition as an object of study it its own right. He comments, “Largely still unexplored Syriac manuscripts provide evidence for the remarkable change of the liturgical rite...The critical study of the contents of the many liturgical books in use in the various Syriac traditions is still very much in its infancy.” <sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup> Given the inchoate nature of research on Syriac liturgies, fundamental questions of cataloguing manuscripts, identifying texts, and recognizing authorial and scribal traditions stand even more at the fore in this sub-field than in the three areas mentioned above, in part because reference works describing Syriac liturgical texts and authors are often incomplete (or even non-existent).</p>

<p id="p11" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p11">Brock concludes by discussing two other major areas of research which stand firmly <i>within</i> the history of Syriac literature: the study of Syriac poetry and the study of Syriac theological literature. These overlapping domains have been studied more than Syriac liturgy; in part out of the interest of scholars in adjacent fields to trace ideas, texts, and influential authors, and in part because of their prominent place within Syriac literature itself. For some Syriac authors, such as Ephrem the Syrian or Philoxenos of Mabbug, scholars have published extensive bibliographies, catalogues of works, and monographs.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> For other authors, especially medieval authors, the full extent of their work has not yet been catalogued. Indeed, until Syriaca.org began to publish author and title information, the most exhaustive resource for identifying authors and works was Anton Baumstark’s <i>Geschichte der syrischen Literature</i> (1922), a reference work now nearly a century old.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> Accordingly, even in the study of core areas of Syriac literature one of the most active areas of research is the preliminary work of identifying texts and authors.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup></p>

<p id="p12" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p12">Brock’s list of primary fields of Syriac research is representative rather than exhaustive; Brock himself has called attention to other areas such as the importance of Syriac Studies to the study of Christian hagiography.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-18" href="#footnote-18">18</a></sup> His vision reflects the traditional focus of the field on Syriac textual sources. The study of Syriac material culture, archaeology, and art history remain at an even earlier stage of scholarship. Moreover, sociological and anthropological analyses of Syriac communities past and present are only a recent development in the field which will hopefully grow further.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-19" href="#footnote-19">19</a></sup> In spite of these limitations, Brock’s survey identifies many of the core questions and concepts around which much of the historical scholarship in the field is oriented: the relationships of texts, manuscripts (as expressions or transmissions of the text), persons, places, and themes to each other and to the historiography of the field. What texts have survived in Syriac and in what manuscripts? Who were their authors, scribes, readers? Where were these texts written, copied, read, transmitted? What patterns can be found in the transmission and influence of texts and ideas? What themes connect Syriac literature? What texts, persons, places, and manuscripts have been the subject of modern scholarly studies? What areas remain unexamined? The Syriaca.org knowledge graph is designed to facilitate research on these questions by digitally modelling these relationships, providing the tools for scholars to trace connections across collections of data about texts, manuscripts, biography, and geography.</p>

<p id="p13" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p13">Such questions remain fundamental to the field of Syriac Studies because the basic historical research needed for identification, disambiguation, and cataloguing is an essential prerequisite before more theoretical levels of analysis can be undertaken. Nevertheless, it is important that this research be done with an eye on the further questions that yet open up. Lucas Van Rompay, a senior scholar in the field, has offered the following observation about how the Syriac literary tradition must be studied <i>both</i> in part and in whole: </p>

<blockquote>A tradition which has existed for nearly two millennia cannot be studied solely as a linear development gradually unfolding in history, whose constituent elements are continuously being piled up like bricks, forming an ever growing, ever expanding monument. This image does not do justice to the dynamics of history. The way the past was viewed, the way people reflected on it, and reacted to it must always be taken into account. Not only the transmission of texts and motifs is important, but also the processes accompanying that transmission are equally important.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-20" href="#footnote-20">20</a></sup></blockquote>

<p id="p14" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p14">As Van Rompay has shown in his own work the relationships between texts, authors, readers, hermeneutics, and communities are themselves subject to change over time and require interpretation as much as the texts themselves.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-21" href="#footnote-21">21</a></sup></p>

<section id="section2.2">

<h3>Scholarly Goals of Syriaca.org</h3>

<p id="p15" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p15">Given recent rapid growth in the field of Syriac Studies it is not surprising that there are many perceived needs among contemporary Syriac scholars. Until the late twentieth century published resources for the study of Syriac were held by exceedingly few academic or ecclesiastical libraries. Syriac scholar Kristian Heal has noted that “[t]he history of Syriac Studies could well be told in terms of the scholars’ search for, or frustrated separation from, the books they wish to study.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-22" href="#footnote-22">22</a></sup> This observation holds true for the vast majority of the past history of Syriac scholarship. In the last generation, however, the nature of this “search” has changed. Over the last quarter century, Syriac Studies has benefitted from the confluence of two trends, a dramatic increase in scholarly publishing related to Syriac (as exemplified in by the dissertation figures <a href="#p6">cited above</a> and evident in the increase of Syriac digital projects) and the general information revolution of the Internet age.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-23" href="#footnote-23">23</a></sup></p>

<p id="p16" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p16">Based on this proliferation of new resources (many online), it is certain that—in terms of raw volume—contemporary scholars of Syriac culture and history have access through the Internet to a greater number of books, reference works, and even copies of manuscripts than scholars have had at any previous time. While such a development is a beneficial one for the growth of knowledge, it can also be disorienting since it is symptomatic of a fundamental shift in the nature of humanistic research.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-24" href="#footnote-24">24</a></sup> The primary concern of the scholar is now less about the scarcity of information (though much essential work remains to be done to preserve and disseminate rare Syriac materials) and more about navigating the deluge of digital information. Greg Crane and other scholars in Classical Studies have called attention to the digitally-induced problem of research in the “million-book library.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-25" href="#footnote-25">25</a></sup> Today, scholars of Syriac must also learn how to handle an overabundance of digital information. For example, a search for the keyword “Ephrem the Syrian” in <i>Google Books</i> returns about 82,000 books.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-26" href="#footnote-26">26</a></sup> Because it is not feasible for a scholar to browse all 82,000 titles, it is clear that the increasing flow in digital information, while beneficial, brings with it new challenges for scholarship.</p>

<p id="p17" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p17">These challenges affect not only specialists in Syriac but also scholars interested in Syriac from broader domains such as Religious Studies or Middle Eastern History. Research on Syriac language, literature, and cultures has grown but non-specialists still struggle to discover these advances in knowledge.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-27" href="#footnote-27">27</a></sup> As I have noted in previous publications, the lack of up-to-date reference works or even standardized terminology makes it difficult even for specialists to stay informed of new discoveries.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-28" href="#footnote-28">28</a></sup> Names of authors, texts, places, and even styles of Romanization of Syriac words vary widely in the literature.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-29" href="#footnote-29">29</a></sup> The lack of controlled or standard vocabulary has meant that authors, texts, and toponyms have been identified (and mis-identified) in multiple ways and thus are often not easily discoverable in digital research engines (such as JSTOR or OCLC WorldCat).</p>

<p id="p18" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p18">Issues of access to Syriac cultural heritage information extend beyond academic researchers to the Syriac heritage communities as well. As the intersecting forces of globalization, commercialization, and the Internet information revolution have threatened to homogenize or erase many forms of traditional cultural expression, scholars have become increasingly aware of their obligations to the cultural communities whose heritage is their object of study.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-30" href="#footnote-30">30</a></sup> Specifically, the 2003 General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) identified two areas of ethical and intellectual concern, the obligation to fully include heritage communities in efforts to safeguard their “intangible cultural heritage” and the need for new methods to preserve “digital cultural heritage”.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-31" href="#footnote-31">31</a></sup> Recent scholarship in the field of Information Science has identified how these issues of preservation and community access should be addressed not only in museum and archeological contexts but also in the organization of information and in the creation and curation of metadata.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-32" href="#footnote-32">32</a></sup> In short, scholars must recognize that the historical data and metadata they curate is not only of interest to historians but should also be recognized as “cultural heritage information” (CHI), e.g. metadata or historical descriptions of cultural heritage of interest to modern communities as part of their identities.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-33" href="#footnote-33">33</a></sup> CHI terminology and approach are relatively recent and thus not widely adopted in the field of Syriac Studies, but the underlying attention to the role of cultural communities in creating, preserving, accessing, and directing academic research on their own heritage is a value increasingly shared by contemporary Syriac scholarship. The genocides experienced by Syriac communities over the past century, and most pointedly in the last decade, have spurred academic initiatives to preserve Syriac cultures through digitization.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-34" href="#footnote-34">34</a></sup> These scholarly efforts have been accompanied by a recognition of how previous scholarship in Syriac studies has at times excluded or even been antagonistic to the contemporary Syriac heritage communities.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-35" href="#footnote-35">35</a></sup> While there are further ways that the field of Syriac Studies can benefit from recent scholarship on CHI, it is noteworthy that numerous Syriac digitization projects already occur in partnership with the heritage communities and that some of the flagship digital resources in Syriac Studies were in fact begun by members of those communities, most notably the projects of Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute. Beth Mardutho’s projects include <i>Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies</i> and the <i>Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage</i>.</p>

<p id="p19" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p19">Syriaca.org is a project born at the intersection of these developments in the field of Syriac Studies with a goal of helping Syriac scholarship thrive in this new information environment. Specifically, Syriaca.org was designed to facilitate the publishing, linking, classification, and discovery of digital data on Syriac literature and culture. The principal objectives of Syriaca.org project are threefold: to compile and classify core data into authority files for the study of Syriac sources, to create digital tools and establish best practices for linking Syriac data and facilitating its reuse and interconnection with the Web of Data, and to link current and future research into a digital knowledge graph for the field of Syriac studies. These three aims were, in part, inspired by similar aspirations in the fields of Classical Studies and Ancient History to create “cyber-infrastructure” for the study of the ancient world.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-36" href="#footnote-36">36</a></sup> These objectives were also developed out of the CHI model of shared use of cultural heritage information. Indeed, it is the shared cultural context of the field of Syriac Studies which provides the unifying principle for the Syriaca.org knowledge graph and its users. The knowledge graph reflects the diverse communities of interest in academic research on Syriac Studies.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-37" href="#footnote-37">37</a></sup></p>

<p id="p20" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p20">In pursuit of these goals, Syriaca.org has published three digital reference works as authority files for Syriac places, persons, and texts: <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>, <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary</i> (in two volumes to date), and <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i> (in two volumes to date).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-38" href="#footnote-38">38</a></sup> A shared digital bibliography supports all three reference works.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-39" href="#footnote-39">39</a></sup> Three additional digital reference works are in preparation: authority files for subject headings, manuscripts, and other material artifacts. On a separate track, Syriaca.org is also preparing a digital tool for the study of the relationships between historical events and persons (<i>SPEAR: Syriac Persons Events and Relations</i>). </p>

<p id="p21" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p21">All of these digital reference works are built around a data model of seven core “entities”. These entities were chosen because of their relevance to the fundamental research questions for the field described above. The entities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Places, e.g., the city of Edessa</li>

<li>Persons (including authors, saints, unnamed persons, and corporate entities), e.g., the author Ephrem the Syrian</li>

<li>Literary Works, e.g., <i>The Life of Abraham Quidounaya</i> by Ephrem the Syrian</li>

<li>Bibliographic Items (modern publications), e.g., J. Lebon, <i>Le monophysisme Sévérien</i> (1909)</li>

<li>Subject Headings (thematic keywords related to Syriac Studies), e.g., “asceticism”</li>

<li>Manuscripts, e.g., British Library Manuscript Add. 14,451</li>

<li>Material Artifacts, e.g., the Edessene Mosaic of Orpheus Taming Wild Animals</li>
</ul>

<p id="p22" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p22">At present Syriaca.org’s digital publications (including those currently in development) can model all of the entity classes above except artifacts. A future database module is planned to model works of art and other artifacts, but that yet-to-be-implemented class will not be discussed in this paper.</p>

<p id="p23" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p23">The design principles for each of these digital publications are shaped by the three methodological objectives of Syriaca.org stated <a href="#p19">above</a>. Syriaca.org’s first goal, to compile and classify core data into authority files related to the study of Syriac sources, was necessitated by the lack of up-to-date reference works for the field of Syriac studies. In this regard, Syriaca.org’s publications are designed to serve the needs of both specialists and non-specialists alike. Although historical sources in Syriac are relevant to a broad swath of historical scholarship they have not been widely studied by historians of the ancient and medieval Middle East. One reason is that a high degree of specialization and familiarization with the literature is necessary to navigate this only partially documented mass of sources. Moreover, even specialists in Syriac encounter significant obstacles in identifying and accessing relevant Syriac materials due to the lack of reference works.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-40" href="#footnote-40">40</a></sup> Accordingly, the first task of Syriaca.org was to aggregate a critical mass of digital data related to Syriac studies and curate it into authority files. To this end, Syriaca.org’s data sets have amassed much larger quantities of data than previous print resources, as can be seen in the three digital reference works which have already been published (<i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>, <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary,</i> and <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i>). <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> is the first reference work ever published in the field of Syriac Studies to publish Syriac place names in Syriac script and the first Syriac geographic reference work to include coordinates. With entries on nearly three thousand individual places, <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> has a wider geographic and chronological coverage than any prior reference works on Syriac historical geography.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-41" href="#footnote-41">41</a></sup> Similarly, <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary</i> is the first attempt at a scholarly prosopography for Syriac Studies. Numerically, <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary</i> has entries on fifty percent more authors (900) than were included in the previous standard, Baumstark’s <i>Geschichte der syrischen Literature</i> (published in 1922). It also includes nearly three times as many entries on saints (1400) than were included in the previous comprehensive study of Syriac hagiography.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-42" href="#footnote-42">42</a></sup> While some volumes of <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i> are still in development, the published volume on hagiography, <i>Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica</i> (based on the unpublished research of Ugo Zanetti and Claude Detienne), has similarly aggregated more titles that previous resources.</p>

<p id="p24" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p24">Much of Syriaca.org’s work to date has been focused on this first goal of aggregating and curating large amounts of digital data into authority files. Bringing the core data for the field into a digital format has been a necessary first step toward building a digital knowledge graph. As part of the process of preparing the data for publication in digital authority files and online reference works, Syriaca.org has established digital best practices for the dissemination and collaborative use of Syriac-related data. Syriaca.org’s multi-author digital publications and its open data approach represent a fundamental shift from the models of scholarship and publishing which have predominated in Syriac Studies. Specifically, the field has been largely shaped by a number of massive single-author reference works. In the nineteenth century, William Wright’s thousand-page <i>Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum</i> (1872) established a model classification of Syriac literature which is still influential today.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-43" href="#footnote-43">43</a></sup> Robert Payne Smith’s <i>Thesaurus Syriacus</i> (1879, 4516 columns) is a similarly-sized single-author work which offered the field a large lexicon and thesaurus of citations.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-44" href="#footnote-44">44</a></sup> In the early twentieth century, these British works were supplemented by a German wave of single-author scholarship: Baumstark’s <i>Geschichte der syrischen Literatur</i> (1922, 378 pages) and Karl Brockelmann’s <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i> (1928, 930 pages).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-45" href="#footnote-45">45</a></sup> While each of these works built on previous scholarship, they also remained largely the product of a sole author’s life-work and offered only a single vision or interpretation of Syriac literature and culture. </p>

<p id="p25" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p25">Such an approach has paid dividends in the past but is not without its drawbacks. This has already been noted more than half a century ago concerning the posthumous publication of Cyril Moss’ <i>Catalogue of Syriac Printed Books and Related Literature in the British Museum</i> in 1962.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-46" href="#footnote-46">46</a></sup> As K.B. Gardner noted is his preface of 1961, the book of over 1500 columns represented “the major life’s work of one man.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-47" href="#footnote-47">47</a></sup> As recently as 2008, Sebastian Brock praised the work as “an essential working tool for all Syriacists.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-48" href="#footnote-48">48</a></sup> And yet Brock and other reviewers have noted the work’s limitations. As Taeke Jansma noted in 1963: “It is to be doubted, therefore, whether ever a bibliography that is even approximately complete can be printed as a book at all, and whether this can still be a one man job. As in so many other fields of learning, what seems to be required is a team of contributors.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-49" href="#footnote-49">49</a></sup> In 1963, only a few humanities scholars were imagining a collaborative world where a computerized bibliography might even be possible.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-50" href="#footnote-50">50</a></sup> In our current era, however, this now fifty-year-old observation now seems almost axiomatic; any attempts at representing the data of an entire field of study surely must be done collaboratively and using media other than print.</p>

<p id="p26" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p26">Accordingly, a second design priority of Syriaca.org has been to build its data model to facilitate scholarly collaboration through Linked Data. Syriaca.org’s use of LOD structures allows its user community to collectively enrich the variety and quantity of data in its knowledge graph.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-51" href="#footnote-51">51</a></sup> All data is open license and readily available in multiple formats for integration with the Web of Data. Syriaca.org publishes editorial guidelines informing users how to submit new data and revisions. As these documentation guidelines note: “Syriaca.org aims to be an excellent collaborative reference work for the specific domain of Syriac Studies, with the dual goals of enabling the research of a specialist audience while remaining comprehensible to a general audience. Because Syriaca.org publishes at a specialist level of expertise, it uses a board of scholar-editors to vet submissions, in order to maintain the verifiability of its data for academic use. All users are encouraged to submit information about the persons, places, works, and other topics described by Syriaca.org with proper citation of academically trustworthy sources...”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-52" href="#footnote-52">52</a></sup> This collaborative framework is essential because Syriac sources from the ancient world are plentiful, but there is no single national library, university, or research institute which has the resources or long-term mandate to maintain authority files or curate data derived from Syriac materials. Because this void is not likely to be remedied at any time in the near future, Syriaca.org has intentionally created an open data infrastructure that enables disparate digital projects to bridge this institutional gap by integrating their data through LOD standards.</p>

<p id="p27" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p27">The third aim of Syriaca.org is the culmination of the first two, the creation of a digital knowledge graph of current and future research related to Syriac literature and culture. This data model has been created for use by three types of end users. For libraries and Linked Data aggregators, Syriaca.org’s reference publications serve as authority files whose URIs (unique identifiers) facilitate disambiguation and federated search. For Syriac specialists, especially those creating digital projects, Syriaca.org’s digital publications serve as models of best practice for how to publish Linked Data for the field of Syriac Studies. Syriaca.org has designed custom open source software and data formats optimized for representing Syriac-related materials in TEI XML and RDF vocabularies. By adopting Syriaca.org’s digital standards, researchers in the field can publish digitally in a format that is immediately ready for linking their projects to the digital knowledge graphs of Syriac Studies, Classics, Medieval Studies, and the Web of Data as a whole. Finally, for a broadly construed non-specialist audience (including members of the Syriac heritage communities, students, and researchers in other fields), Syriaca.org’s digital publications serve as core reference works offering a variety of versatile entry points to exploring an ever-growing Syriac Linked Data cloud of cultural heritage information. This Web of data includes not only the data of Syriaca.org but an increasing number of partner digital projects using the Syriac.org standards, such as the electronic edition of <i>Gorgias Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Syriac Heritage</i>, the <i>Digital Syriac Corpus</i>, and the <i>E-ktobe</i> database of Syriac manuscripts.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-53" href="#footnote-53">53</a></sup></p>

<h2>The Syriaca.org Knowledge Graph</h2>

<p id="p28" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p28">The Syriaca.org data model is designed around the seven core conceptual entities relevant to the perennial research questions described above: persons, places, primary source texts, bibliographic citations, keyword classifications, manuscripts, and material artifacts. The role that these entities play in the structure of the Syriaca.org knowledge graph is illustrated by the following user scenario. A researcher working with an unpublished medieval Syriac manuscript encounters a previously-unknown text attributed to a known author, for example Ephrem the Syrian. She consults <i>The Syriac Biographical Dictionary</i> for an entry on the author that links to a listing of known works by Ephrem in <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i>. Consulting that list, she determines that her text has not previously been identified. Following the editorial and digital standards established for collaboration with Syriaca.org, the researcher submits a digital description of both the text and the manuscript shelf mark for inclusion in <i>A New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i>. Later, another researcher who has come across the same text in another manuscript but without attribution to an author consults <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i> for text titles (or incipits). Upon finding the entry for the sermon that second researcher is able to discover that the text’s author has been identified through the previous scholar’s manuscript research. This second scholar then submits his manuscript citation to <i>The New Handbook of Syriac Literature</i> to increase the data about that text. </p>

<p id="p29" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p29">This research scenario demonstrates why Linked Data structures are an excellent fit for many of the research goals of historical scholarship. The LOD model (also called the “Semantic Web” or “Web of Data”) was developed to easily link data typical of the World Wide Web, e.g. heterogeneously-structured and distributed information spanning multiple domains and sources.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-54" href="#footnote-54">54</a></sup> In a similar fashion, historians often need to synthesize fragmentary historical data drawn from an eclectic and diachronic sample of ancient and medieval sources. Moreover, the non-hierarchical nature of the LOD graph model means that it can “represent the fluidity of the real world, where things can be related to each other in…complex ways” in a manner that other data structures cannot (such as data stored in tables or a tree hierarchs).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-55" href="#footnote-55">55</a></sup> In Syriaca.org’s knowledge graph, each specific entity is an abstract concept which can be described or defined in terms of its relationship to other entities. A particular manuscript can be described in relation to the individual works it contains, the authors who wrote those works, previous owners of the manuscript, or the geographic places related to the manuscript. By making inferences based on explicit connections in the graph, historians can uncover new connections in the data. For example, the simplified figure below demonstrates how the graph data model can reveal connections between two places (the province of Bostra in Mesopotamia and a monastery in Egypt) based on their mutual connection through a manuscript connected to both places.</p>

<h3>Linked Open Data Standards</h3>

<p id="p30" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p30">The general principles of Linked Open Data have been effectively introduced elsewhere in this volume, so while this section will define basic terms occasionally, readers are also referred to those earlier papers for a general introduction to LOD structures.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-56" href="#footnote-56">56</a></sup> The core feature of Syriaca.org’s LOD model is that it is built around Tim Berners-Lee’s first rule for Linked Data: use uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to “name” things.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-57" href="#footnote-57">57</a></sup> In Syriaca.org’s knowledge graph, each entity is an individual abstract concept identified by a unique URI. For example, the person known as Ephrem the Syrian is identified by the URI: “<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code>” and the city of Edessa where he spent much of his life is identified as “<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>.” The necessity of using unique strings of characters instead of traditional names arises from the occurrence of homonymous entities. For example, <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i> has entries for 69 different churches and monasteries each with the name “St. George.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-58" href="#footnote-58">58</a></sup> Accordingly, all Syriaca.org URIs are unique—each identifying only one conceptual entity. Thus, every “Monastery of St. George” is assigned a separate URI.</p>

<p id="p31" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p31">Syriaca.org URIs are not merely random strings of text and numbers; they are HTTP URIs, meaning that each URI is also a URL (a Uniform Resource Locator, e.g. an HTTP address).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-59" href="#footnote-59">59</a></sup> Thus, Syriaca.org’s URI for Ephrem the Syrian is “<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code>,” a valid HTTP address, rather than merely “<code>person/13</code>” (even though the latter would be sufficient as a unique identifier). The benefit of using HTTP URIs is that these URIs are “self-descriptive” in that each URI contains within itself an HTTP address linking to a Web document describing or defining the concept identified by the URI.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-60" href="#footnote-60">60</a></sup> Each Syriaca.org URI is also a machine-actionable method for retrieving information over the Web describing that URI. This use of HTTP URIs for Linked Data differentiates the “Web of Data” from the traditional World Wide Web of documents. On the traditional Web, a URI is the name of the same document it links to.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-61" href="#footnote-61">61</a></sup> Thus the homepage for the <i>New York Times</i> (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">https://www.nytimes.com/</a>) returns a representation of the front page of the current issue of the <i>New York Times</i> newspaper. For the linked Web of Data, an additional relationship between HTTP URIs and Web documents is possible. Although perhaps obvious to state, the Web document which is returned from a Syriaca.org URI is <i>only</i> a definition of the concept named by the URI, not the entity itself (thus the address <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code> does not allow one to download the real-world city of Edessa, but a document describing that city!). In LOD terminology, Syriaca.org’s conceptual URIs are said to identify “real-world objects” rather than identify information resources (documents) on the Web.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-62" href="#footnote-62">62</a></sup> For example, the URI “<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code>” identifies the historical concept of the person Ephrem the Syrian. Although that URI also serves as a link to a Web document describing Ephrem, the real-world concept identified by the URI is the person not the document about the person.</p>

<p id="p32" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p32">The term “real-world objects” requires further clarification from the perspective of historical research. In the Syriaca.org knowledge graph, each URI represents a conceptual thing with a mental existence related to, but not reducible to, its historical or physical manifestation. Syriaca.org adopted this broad definition so that mythological and other ahistorical persons, places, and concepts can be assigned URIs (and thus are considered “real-world” objects according to Web of Data parlance in spite of the fact that their existence is abstract rather than material). For example, the concept identified by the URI <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code> encompasses not only the historical person Ephrem the Syrian, but also the supra-historical hagiographical and pseudepigraphal traditions. Following this same logic, any historical concept can be described in the Syriaca.org knowledge graph, even if its historical existence was only in the cultural imaginary.</p>

<p id="p33" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p33">Following LOD best practices, Syriaca.org uses an HTTP protocol called “content negotiation” so that the HTTP addresses for conceptual URIs can return descriptive Web documents in different formats for different uses. If a human user submits a request through a web browser for the Syriaca.org URI for the city of Edessa (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>), the Syriaca.org server will “dereference” the URI and return an HTML page in prose, a format useful for human readers.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-63" href="#footnote-63">63</a></sup> This HTML document (which is identified by its own URI, <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78.html">http://syriaca.org/place/78.html</a></code>) defines and describes the concept of the place “Edessa”. If a computer (an application programming interface or API) sends a request for Linked Data to the same URI for the city of Edessa (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>), content negotiation will result in a different response, returning a Linked Data document (identified by the URI <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78.rdf">http://syriaca.org/place/78.rdf</a></code>) structured according to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) specifications for Linked Data. Syriaca.org represents the same RDF data document in two formats: RDF/XML and Turtle, the Terse RDF Triple Language. Finally, the native data format used by Syriaca.org is TEI XML. Accordingly, representation of the same data in TEI XML is also available through content negotiation. The various data formats available through content negotiation are listed in the table below:</p>

<p id="p34" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p34">While TEI XML is the native data format for all of Syriaca.org’s data, this data is serialized (transformed) into RDF data formats to facilitate computational queries across the knowledge graph. For example, using the data dump available at <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/13.ttl">http://syriaca.org/place/13.ttl</a></code>, a machine-structured query could return results identifying a connection between the person Ephrem the Syrian (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code>) and the city of Edessa (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>). In its most generic form, Syriaca.org expresses this connection between a person and a place in Turtle RDF in this way: </p>

 <figcaption>Example 1: Simplified Turtle RDF Encoding of a Person to Place Relationship</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p35" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p35">Syntactically, this Turtle encoding is a series of triples composed of subjects, predicates, and objects.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-64" href="#footnote-64">64</a></sup> In human prose, this encoding asserts that the URI <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code> is a person who has an unspecified relation to the URI <code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code> which is a place. This example demonstrates in a simplified way how the use of URIs for Syriaca.org’s seven core types of entity allows Syriaca.org’s knowledge graph to model connections between entities such as people and places. Conceptually these connections are conceived as a graph of nodes and connecting edges. The links (edges) between individual entities (nodes) create the knowledge graph. The graph can be expressed in a variety of formats. For instance, the Turtle RDF data from <a href="#code01">Example 1</a> above is visualized as <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a> below:</p>

<figure id="figure02">
	<img class="img-wide" alt="" src="images/fig02.png"/>
	<figcaption>Figure 2: Simplified Visualization of a Person to Place Relationship</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p36" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p36">The RDF data dump available through dereferencing any one of Syriaca.org’s conceptual URIs is not the totality of structured data available about that URI in the Syriaca.org knowledge graph. An HTTP request for an individual Syriac.org conceptual URI returns only a minimum reference dataset provided by Syriaca.org to help define and disambiguate the URI for users.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-65" href="#footnote-65">65</a></sup> Users who wish to query all references to a URI in the Syriaca.org database have two options for accessing the entire dataset. They can download a serialization of the entire database as RDF triples in a single file (available through periodic archiving in a git repository) and manipulate their own copy of the data.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-66" href="#footnote-66">66</a></sup> Alternately users may send queries in the SPARQL Query Language to be processed by a SPARQL endpoint on the Syriaca.org server.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-67" href="#footnote-67">67</a></sup></p>

<p id="p37" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p37">In order to construct queries and inferences across the entire Syriaca.org data cloud, it is helpful to know the types of links present in the data. In their Linked Data primer, Tom Heath and Christian Bizer provide a useful taxonomy of RDF links: relationship links, identity links, and vocabulary links.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-68" href="#footnote-68">68</a></sup> All three of these types of connections are employed by Syriaca.org in structuring its Linked Data.</p>

<p id="p38" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p38">The most common type of RDF link in the Syriaca.org knowledge graph is the relationship link. Relationship links describe Syriaca.org conceptual URIs in terms of their relationships to other URIS and link to related data. The link made between the person, Ephrem the Syrian (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/person/13">http://syriaca.org/person/13</a></code>), and the place, Edessa (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>), as expressed in a Turtle triple in <a href="#code01">Example 1</a> above, is an illustration of a relationship link. A Linked Data application (an API or a SPARQL query) which is given this triple will then be able to look up (dereference) both URIs through Syriaca.org and make inferences based on further data points provided in that look up which are only implicit in the triple itself. For example, because the graph can overlay data about a person URI with data about a place URI, a user could write a sophisticated query searching for which cities have the most connections to persons who are also authors. It should be noted that while Syriaca.org primarily structures its relationship links to refer to other Syriaca.org URIs, it also uses external URIs. In <a href="#code01">Example 1</a> above, the description of Ephrem the Syrian as a “person” relies on a URI for the concept of person (<code><a href="http://lawd.info/ontology/Person">http://lawd.info/ontology/Person</a></code>) which is part of the LAWD ontology created by the Linked Ancient World Data Initiative.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-69" href="#footnote-69">69</a></sup></p>

<p id="p39" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p39">Another way in which the Syriaca.org knowledge graph points to external resources is through identity links. Bizer and Heath explain that “identity links point at URI aliases used by other data sources to identify the same real-world object or abstract concept. Identity links enable clients to retrieve further descriptions about an entity from other data sources.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-70" href="#footnote-70">70</a></sup> Identity links map Syriaca.org URIs to URIs from external sources (such as the <i>Virtual International Authority File</i> or the <i>Pleiades</i> gazetteer) which refer to the same concepts or “real-world objects”. For example, in the Syriaca.org knowledge graph, the following external URIs are all described as being a “close match” for the Syriaca.org URI for the place of Edessa (<code><a href="http://syriaca.org/place/78">http://syriaca.org/place/78</a></code>):</p>

<p id="p40" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p40">Sometimes Syriaca.org uses identity links in order to align its data with major academic digital resources such as the <i>Pleiades</i> gazetteer or <i>Encyclopedia of Islam</i>. Syriaca.org’s use of identity links does not, however, necessarily imply endorsement of the linked resources. In some cases, the use of identity links is pragmatic. While Syriaca.org does not vouch for the reliability of Wikipedia data, it is the case that Wikipedia URIs (and the related URIs of LOD projects such as DBpedia and Wikidata) are some of the most widely interlinked conceptual URIs on the Web. Providing identity links to Wikipedia increases the discoverability of the Syriaca.org URIs and facilitates the interlinking of the Syriaca.org knowledge graph with other resources on the Web of Data. Pragmatically, using Wikipedia URIs makes it possible for Syriaca.org to integrate its data with other projects beyond Wikipedia through the shared identity links to Wikipedia. (As an historical note, Syriaca.org began collecting data in 2010 before the Wikidata project began. At the time, Syriaca.org’s data was aligned with Wikipedia URIs since this facilitated linking to DBpedia. Since that time, Wikidata URIs have begun to replace Wikipedia URIs in widespread usage and a future revision of Syriaca.org’s data will include identity links with these URIs as well.) </p>

<p id="p41" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p41">One question that often arises about the Syriaca.org project (and related projects) is whether identity links are redundant. Why should Syriaca.org create a new URI for the concept of the place Edessa when a URI for this concept is already in use in the <i>Pleiades</i> gazetteer (<code><a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/658457">http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/658457</a></code>)? Would it not suffice for Syriaca.org to use the <i>Pleiades</i> URI in its data in the first place? This is a legitimate question whose answer must come from recognizing that the scholarly perspective and agenda of the <i>Pleiades</i> gazetteer and Syriaca.org’s <i>Syriac Gazetteer</i> are similar but not identical. In other words, each digital publication serves overlapping but different audiences. For this reason, Syriaca.org—as an editorial policy—creates (“mints”) its own conceptual URIs for all of its seven core entities. This autonomy ensures that the conceptual definitions of Syriaca.org’s entities remains consistent with its editorial principles and do not shift over time (as might be the case if Syriaca.org relied solely on concepts and URIs defined by an external project). In the case of Wikipedia, it is easy to see how political and cultural concerns (and a different set of editorial values) could create situations in which externally-defined concepts could differ from those of scholars in the field of Syriac Studies. In fact, such a difference in perspective can be seen in <a href="#code02">Example 2</a> above where Wikipedia distinguishes the ancient and medieval city of Edessa from the modern Turkish city of Şanlıurfa. Because no such distinction exists in Syriac sources, Syriaca.org needs only one URI where Wikipedia has two. Recognizing that there will be perspectival differences anytime editors have to map equivalences between datasets, Syriaca.org chooses to identify most of its identity links as reflecting a “close match” rather than the more commonly used “same as”. Thus in <a href="#code02">Example 2</a>, Syriaca.org’s concept of the place “Edessa” is a close match for both “Edessa” and “Şanlıurfa” in Wikipedia.</p>

<p id="p42" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p42">“Vocabulary links” are the third type in Heath and Bizer’s taxonomy. They explain that “vocabulary links point from data to the definitions of the vocabulary terms that are used to represent the data.”<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-71" href="#footnote-71">71</a></sup> As can be seen in examples <a href="#code01">1</a>, <a href="#code02">2</a>, and <a href="#code04">4</a> (see appendix below for the latter), Syriaca.org draws upon a variety of robust LOD vocabularies which are also used by other cultural heritage projects. Some of these vocabularies are widely used on the Web of Data and others have been specifically created to meet the needs of expressing historical Linked Data. As already observed above, <a href="#code01">Example 1</a> includes the use of URIs for the concept of person and place (e.g. <code><a href="http://lawd.info/ontology/Place">http://lawd.info/ontology/Place</a></code>) which are part of an ontology that a community of ancient historians collaborating on the Linked Ancient World Data Initiative (LAWDI) have been preparing since 2012.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-72" href="#footnote-72">72</a></sup> In addition to linking to LAWD URIs for definitions of concepts, Syriaca.org relies on a number of ontologies for the names of RDF classes and properties (classes and properties occur frequently as the predicates in RDF triples). Some of these class and property names are from widely used LOD vocabularies such as Dublin Core, Schema.org, and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). Others come from the more specialized historical ontologies such as LAWD or the Standards for Networking Ancient Prosopographies: Data and Relations in Greco-Roman Names (SNAP:DRGN). Since these ontologies are described in other papers of this volume, they are not described in detail here other than to note that Syriaca.org has followed the best practice of reusing widely deployed terms whenever possible and creating its own “proprietary” vocabularies or ontologies only as a last resort. In its current stage of development, Syriaca.org has begun developing a proprietary vocabulary for a subject taxonomy specific to Syriac Studies. Whenever possible, this taxonomy also includes vocabulary links which map Syriaca.org’s ontology to existing taxonomies such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings or the Getty Vocabularies.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-73" href="#footnote-73">73</a></sup></p>

<h3>Integrating the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines</h3>

<p id="p43" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p43">The preceding sections have demonstrated how Syriaca.org has found the structures of RDF useful for encoding its knowledge graph. At the same time, the Syriaca.org editors have also found there remain core aspects of historical scholarship for which the technical paradigm of Linked Data is currently insufficient. In particular, because LOD structures are designed with the precision needed to be machine actionable, these data structures can sometimes conflict with the humanistic scholar’s interest in preserving the nuance and ambiguity of prose sources and the historian’s emphasis on the role of provenance in the interpretation of historical data. It is in the use of descriptive vocabularies that Syriaca.org has most needed to adapt its use of the Linked Data model to the specific epistemological needs of historical scholarship. Syriaca.org’s data is primarily oriented around textual sources; that is, the data is frequently extracted from textual sources or is metadata about such texts (e.g. information about authorship or provenance). Preserving the proximity of the data to the nuance of textual sources is perhaps the primary design value of Syriaca.org. At times the ambiguities of prose make it impossible to encode this data directly into RDF Linked Data without losing some of the semantic value of context in the primary source. When Syriaca.org began to first encode data in the period 2010-2012, the ontologies and data specifications most common on the Web of Data were largely designed for data derived from online networks of friends, governmental data sets, or the natural sciences.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-74" href="#footnote-74">74</a></sup> As Cory Doctorow has noted, these types ontologies are built for data sets which are (naively?) assumed to be uniformly accurate and reliable.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-75" href="#footnote-75">75</a></sup> Such assumptions are simply unworkable for historians whose data is never uniform and is usually derived from ambiguous and even contradictory sources.</p>

<p id="p44" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p44">Since 2012, the work of several networks of historians (the other authors in this volume, for example) have begun to draft useful LOD ontologies for historical data. While consensus and collaboration are growing, even at present the existing RDF vocabularies are not yet universally well-suited for representing historical data with the granularity and fidelity to the textual sources that is generally expected in the discipline of History.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-76" href="#footnote-76">76</a></sup> For all assertions (RDF triples) made in the Linked Data, Syriaca.org assumes that users will want to access the original source (primary or secondary) for those assertions. This emphasis on sourcing has had two influences on the design of the Syriaca.org data model. First, Syriaca.org requires that all data points have the digital equivalent of a footnote indicating information provenance. While data provenance can be indicated with annotations in RDF, its development was somewhat of an afterthought in the development of the Web of Data and remains cumbersome.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-77" href="#footnote-77">77</a></sup> Second, at times prose sources may indicate an unnamed or ambiguous relationship between entities which Syriaca.org might wish to model with Linked Data. For example, two places might be mentioned in a medieval text as both being “near” a third place but without specificity. While this ambiguous relationship could be modelled somewhat generically in RDF, a historian will likely want to consult the original passage in the historical text for herself since the context may reveal something which cannot be easily encoded. Given these constraints, Syriaca.org needed a base data format better-suited to encoding and annotating historical source texts.</p>

<p id="p45" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p45">This need prompted the project to look beyond the current usage of the Semantic Web for a data format which would allow the Syriaca.org data sets to reuse primary sources. This search was undertaken in the spirit of Linked Data best practices which encourage the reuse of widely shared vocabularies. For the scholarly encoding and analysis of textual and historical data, such a widely-adopted set of terms exists, but it predates the Semantic web and thus is not an RDF vocabulary. This vocabulary is the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-78" href="#footnote-78">78</a></sup> The TEI guidelines are a set of over 500 XML tags which have been curated and defined by a scholarly user community for more than two decades.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-79" href="#footnote-79">79</a></sup> Given the close fit of TEI Guidelines to Syriaca.org’s textual data, our approach was to create a hybrid data model which could serialize the structures of Linked Data out of the textual mark-up of the TEI. The resulting “serialization stack” uses RDF as an interchange format but retains TEI XML as the native data format. All data is authored in TEI XML and then serialized (e.g. generated) into RDF and HTML. The native use of TEI allows the Syriaca.org knowledge graph to document data provenance and cite sources following standard scholar practices of citation. An abbreviated example of this serialization is illustrated as Examples <a href="#code03">3</a> and <a href="#code04">4</a> and Figures <a href="#figure04">4</a> and <a href="#figure05">5</a> in the appendix. While Syriaca.org’s combination of RDF and TEI is perhaps not typical, it is nevertheless compatible with the model of content negotiation at the heart of the Web of Data. As noted in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a> above, a request for a document describing URI for the city of Edessa can be filled in three ways. The document served can be an HTML page (for a human with a web browser) or an RDF representation (for a machine query) or the original TEI XML file from which both the HTML and RDF are serialized depending on the preference of the request (for use by either a human editor or an XML API). This approach has the benefit of serializing Syriaca.org’s data as Linked Data, while still retaining a more granular original form of encoded data.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p id="p46" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p46">Syriaca.org’s Linked Data model was developed to meet specific needs in the field of Syriac Studies. The present author would like to make it clear that the creation of Syriaca.org has been a collaborative process and credit for its design is due to a number of scholarly editors (Daniel Schwartz, Jeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent, Thomas Carlson, Jamey Walters, Nathan Gibson, and Michelle Taylor). In addition, the technical implementation and design benefitted from the work of talented developers who created the Srophé web application which stores the Syriaca.org knowledge graph including Tom Elliott, Hugh Cayless, and especially Winona Salesky.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-80" href="#footnote-80">80</a></sup> The staff of Vanderbilt University Libraries and the Linked Data Working Group lead by Steve Baskauf and Cliff Anderson are also due credit for offering support and advice in the implementation of our Linked Data approach. More broadly, Syriaca.org’s general design has drawn heavily upon digital best practices in the adjacent fields of Classics or Medieval Studies as illustrated in the other articles in this volume.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-81" href="#footnote-81">81</a></sup> Syriaca.org’s first reference work, <i>The Syriac Gazetteer</i>, elaborated on the data model for geography used by the <i>Pleiades</i> community gazetteer and the emerging Linked Data collaborations which have produced the <i>Pelagios Commons</i>.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-82" href="#footnote-82">82</a></sup> Because the Syriaca.org entities (persons, places, texts, etc.) are basic analytical concepts employed widely in ancient and medieval history, it is hoped that our experience will be a useful case study for historians looking to digitally model cultural heritage information through Linked Open Data.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-83" href="#footnote-83">83</a></sup></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-1">1</a></sup> This article is a revision and expansion of earlier published descriptions of Syriaca.org and it draws on and reuses some prose from those publications including: David A. Michelson, “Syriaca.org as a Test Case for Digitally Re-Sorting the Ancient World,” in <i>Ancient Worlds in Digital Culture</i>, ed. C. Clivaz, P. Dilley and D. Hamidović (Leiden: Brill, 2016), 59–85; David A. Michelson and Daniel L. Schwartz, “Syriaca.org: New Digital Tools for the Study of the Medieval Middle East,” in <i>Istoričeskij Opyt Mirovyh Civilizacij I Rossiâ: Materialy IV Meždunarodnoj Naučno-Praktičeskoj Konferencii 13 Noâbrâ 2015 G, </i>ed. I. K. Lapšina and O. V. Zaharova (Vladimir: Vladimirskij Gosudarstvennyj Universitet, 2016), 19–23. Both of these publications are reused here under the terms of the CC-BY 4.0 license. This current paper is also released under the same license.<br/>&#8194;&#8194;I am grateful to my previous co-author, Syriaca.org Director Daniel L. Schwartz, for allowing me to reuse our joint writing. I am also grateful for the opportunity to develop many of the ideas here which were first born in editorial meetings with my Syriaca.org co-editors and collaborators including Thomas A. Carlson, Nathan P. Gibson, Kristian Heal, Jeanne-Nicole Mellon Saint-Laurent, Winona Salesky, Michelle Taylor, and James Walters. A grant from the Library Dean’s Fellows Program at Vanderbilt University’s Jean &amp; Alexander Heard Library for the project “Linked Data from the Medieval Middle East” funded work by Alex Ayris to develop a draft RDF serialization of Syriaca.org’s data (see Alex Ayris and David A. Michelson, “Developing Linked Open Dataset,” <i>Project News from Syriaca.org</i>, April 19, 2016).<br/>&#8194;&#8194;In addition, the larger ancient world Linked Data community has been the source of much inspiration especially Tom Elliott, Sebastian Heath, and Hugh Cayless and the participants of the Linked Ancient World Data Institute (LAWDI), held at NYU in 2012. I am especially grateful to Sarah Bond and Paul Dilley for organizing the “Linking the Big Ancient Mediterranean” conference at the University of Iowa in 2016 and for inviting me to revise my remarks for publication here. Cliff Anderson, Steve Baskauf, Suellen Stringer-Hye, and other colleagues in the Linked Data and Semantic Web Working Group at Vanderbilt University’s Heard Library have been a constant source of answers to my questions about adapting Linked Data to Syriaca.org. Finally, Michelle M. Taylor provided a number of useful clarifications after reading the draft of this article.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-9"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-9">9</a></sup> Search conducted on the ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global (<a href="http://search.proquest.com/pqdtft">http://search.proquest.com/pqdtft</a>), undertaken October 9, 2020. It should be noted that abstracts were indexed only beginning in 1980, so the growth curve is distorted by this feature. Nevertheless, a search for the word “Syriac” in titles reveals a similar curve on a smaller set of results and without any concern about the sample distortion. This growth curve is not unique to Syriac but reflects the general growth of humanities and higher education. Similar curves were present for searches on other ancient languages, such as Akkadian. While a search was not as easily possible for dissertations in scholarly languages other than English, it is the anecdotal observation of this author that this trend would be similar though not quite as exponential in French or German, where the tradition of Syriac scholarship is older. From these representative numbers, it is probable that—worldwide—half of all dissertations touching on Syriac topics have been written in the last quarter century.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-37"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-37">37</a></sup> To be clear, Syriaca.org’s purview (and competency) is limited to the field of Syriac Studies and academic research on Syriac. Thus the Syriaca.org knowledge graph is not merely a data dump of Syriac digital data found on the web but instead reflects a cloud of data based on certain disciplinary models and conventions. At the same time, Syriaca.org’s implementation of the CHI model is intended to prevent the Syriaca.org knowledge graph from being of interest <i>only </i>to scholars to the neglect of the heritage communities.</p>
