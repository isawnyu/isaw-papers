 <meta name="DC.abstract" content="Alcohol’s magical effect to induce a transformation of state, whether physical or psychological, bane or boon, is a recurring theme in ancient Greek literature, art, and cult practice. The potent power of fermented beverage seems likened to a transformative potion as either a gift or a curse from the gods. This paper examines multiple examples of visual, literary, and archaeological evidence in support of this theme. The Odyssey's tale of Circe's elixir might be read as a caution against conspicuous consumption, which is supported by the visual interpretation of painted kylix &quot;eye cups&quot; and rhyton vessels. Interior and exterior decoration of Greek drinking vessels refer directly to Dionysian tales of alcohol-induced transformation, while additional legends of the wine god's coterie offer copious examples of the relationships between fermentation, intoxication, metamorphosis, and animalistic behavior. Beer, wine, and mead take center stage before the advent of distilled liquors like whiskey and brandy, however Homeric literary accounts and contemporaneous archaeological evidence of mixed fermented drinks suggest our modern beverage categorization does not always apply in antiquity." />

<blockquote id="blockquote1">She brought them inside and seated them on chairs and benches, and mixed them a potion with barley and cheese and pale honey added to Pramnian wine, but put into the mixture malignant drugs to make them forgetful of their own country. When she had given them this and they had drunk it down, next thing she struck them with her wand and drove them into her pig pens and they took on the look of pigs with the heads and voices and bristles of pigs, but the minds within them stayed as had been before.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></blockquote>

<p id="p1" class="textindent0" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p1">This tale from ancient Greece might bring to mind the polymorphing magicks of Shakespearean witchcraft or the sorcery of Grimm's fairytales. Sung by generations of Greek rhapsodes before putting pen to paper, this spellbinding scene from Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> could have been a favorite among doe-eyed children millennia ago. Here we find Odysseus and his men having crash-landed on the island of the witch-queen Circe. While Odysseus keeps dutiful watch on shore, his men investigate the lair of the witch and are beguiled by Circe to drink of her magical potion, whereby with the touch of her wand, they are transformed into pigs.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p id="p2" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p2">In this paper, I explore the recurring relationships between fermentation, intoxication, metamorphosis, and animalistic behavior in ancient Greek myths, cult practice, art, and literature. We first examine select primary evidence from Greek authors, artists, and society at large celebrating the theme of alcohol's magical effect to induce a transformation of state, whether physical or psychological, boon or bane. We then explore one possible motivation for this association stemming fundamentally from the contemporary understanding of the fermentation process. </p>
<p id="p3" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p3">A magnificent vessel in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts cleverly captures multiple moments from the <i>Odyssey</i> passage, wherein Odysseus's men are already midway in metamorphosis as Circe hands them the potent potable (Figure 1). Cleverly, the artist has painted this scene on a kylix in the precise shape of the vessel Circe, herself, is using to administer the potion. Does this conspicuous coincidence give the drinker a moment of pause? With each casual glance at his cup and the scene thereon as the wine gradually disappears from the vessel, the drinker is encouraged to consider if he will share the fate of Odysseus's men, transformed into a pig after imbibing his magical alcoholic elixir. I wonder if the threat of Circe's potion loomed in the mind of the comic author Epicharmus when writing: &quot;Drinking leads to wandering the streets drunk, and wandering the streets drunk leads to acting like a pig, and acting like a pig leads to a lawsuit, (and a lawsuit leads to being found guilty), and being found guilty leads to shackles, stocks, and a fine.&quot;<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup></p>

<p id="p4" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p4">Legends of Dionysus, god of wine, theater, and reverie, are replete with suggestions of alcohol's potent power as a transformative potion. We turn to another kylix, the so-called Dionysus Cup in Munich (Figure 2). The interior of this <i>pièce de résistance</i> by the master painter and potter Exekias depicts a fabulous legend of the god as first told in the <i>Homeric Hymn 7</i>, a hymn to Dionysus. Herein the god, having been mistaken for a wealthy mortal, was kidnapped for ransom by a ruthless band of pirates. In a climactic turn of events, the god unleashed his wrath, flooding the ship's deck in a magically invoked torrent of wine and summoning illusions of ferocious wild beasts. The beasts lunged at the pirates, who promptly jumped into the sea in an effort to escape, but the god enjoyed the last laugh as the scurrilous pirates transformed into dolphins before striking the waves.</p>
<p id="p5" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p5">As with Boston's &quot;Circe cup,&quot; we enjoy another playful visual treat in the <i>Dionysus Cup</i>, where the exterior bears the painted image of large glaring eyes (Figure 3). While the drinker holds the cup aloft to his lips, quaffing the intoxicating concoction, he would seem to don a bestial mask, becoming a pig much like Odysseus's men, transformed again by the potent potion of wine.</p>

<p id="p6" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p6">The worship of Dionysus may induce a transformative state in his followers, such as the permanently hybridized satyrs skirting the boundary between civilization and the wilds and the mere mortal maenads, whose Dionysian transformation was psychological in nature. Through the divine <i>enthusiasmos</i> (literally &quot;being filled with the god&quot;) and certainly plenty of ritualistic drinking,<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> maenads would be transformed by the god into animalistic predators of the wilds in mind alone, while their physical form would remain human (so, quite the opposite of Odysseus's men). In the rite known as <i>sparagmos</i>, the cult practitioners would then chase down and dismember live game, consuming their raw flesh and blood.</p>

<p id="p7" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p7">Some Greek rulers did not wholeheartedly greet the untamed practices and licentious pageantry of Dionysus's cult with open arms, which generally culminated in disaster. Recalled most famously in Euripides's <i>Bacchae</i>, Theban king Pentheus prohibited worship of the god. Ultimately Dionysus induces the maenads during their wild wooded ritual to perceive the spying Pentheus as a wild animal. Believing him to be a giant boar, they descend on the unsuspecting king and tear him limb from limb in ritual <i>sparagmos</i> (Figure 4). The Thracian king Lycurgus encounters a somewhat similar fate replete with intoxication, psychological transformation, and physical dismemberment. Hyginus offers a fairly succinct synopsis:</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote2">Lycurgus, son of Dryas, drove Liber [Dionysus] from his kingdom. When he denied that Liber was a god, and had drunk wine, and in drunkenness tried to violate his mother, he then tried to cut down the vines, because he said wine was a bad medicine in that it affected the mind. Under madness sent by Liber he killed his wife and son. Liber threw Lycurgus himself to his panthers on Rhodope, a mountain of Thrace, over which he ruled. He is said to have cut off one foot thinking it was a vine.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup></blockquote>

<p id="p8" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p8">The immediate metaphor explored herein of alcohol and intoxication engendering animalistic transformation is surely not lost on the reader. Its recurring expression in ancient Greek religion, art, literature, and lore as literal metamorphosis and madness, however, may find a link in an early attempt to understand the fermentation process. While the microbiological intricacies of fermentation were not fully understood until the 19th century, Classical intellectuals certainly recognized the profound transformation process through fermentation, though largely in reference to bread and beer. Plutarch informs us that:</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote3">Yeast is itself also the product of corruption, and produces corruption in the dough with which it is mixed; for the dough becomes flabby and inert, and altogether the process of leavening seems to be one of putrefaction; at any rate if it goes too far, it completely sours and spoils the flour.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup></blockquote>
<p id="p9" rel="dcterms:hasPart" resource="#p9">The &quot;father of botany,&quot; Theophrastus, tells us in his <i>On the Causes of Plants</i> that &quot;They even turn into drinkable juices some [products] which they have caused to depart from their nature and have somewhat rotted, such as those who make wines from barley and wheat and the so-called <i>zuthos</i> in Egypt.&quot;<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-7" href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup> It is unclear to what extent Classical intellectuals likened the fermentation process of beer to that of wine, but to a superstitious mind the yield of such delicious and intoxicating elixirs as beer from barley and wine from grapes could seem nothing short of magic.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup> Just as yeast was thought to induce corruption in dough and alcoholic fermentation was believed to cause a fundamental departure from the liquid's original nature, so too would it seem that the drinker of intoxicating liquid was thought to inherit that corruption and departure from nature through some form of sympathetic magic. Such corruption and departure from nature would ultimately manifest itself in the drinker as a physical or psychological transformation into the baser beasts of nature.</p>
