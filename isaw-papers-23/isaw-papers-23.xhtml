<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p id="p1" class="textindent0">Book VII of the <i>Almagest</i> presents one of the most enduring parts of Hellenistic astronomy, that is, the theory of precession. Ptolemy points to Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. -190 – c. -120) as the one responsible for its discovery. As part of the discussion surrounding precession Ptolemy introduces us to a discussion which, distant as it may be from our –and possibly Ptolemy’s– theoretical perspective, appeared as a genuinely interesting debate in Hipparchus’ times: are all the stars subjected to precession, or does it only affect the zodiacal ones? Implicit in this question is another, more general one: are the so-called fixed stars truly fixed? In order provide an answer to them, Ptolemy tells us that Hipparchus determined many stellar configurations.  While most of the ones Ptolemy refers to are straight lines formed by three or more stars, it is possible that the original set was much more varied. After presenting the Hipparchian configurations and declaring that they remained, about three centuries later, as they were in Hipparchus’ times, Ptolemy gives the reader a new set of configurations of his own, in order to provide future astronomers with a more secure basis to check the hypothesis that the stars are all fixed in position relative to each other.</p>

<p id="p2">In this paper I will give a detailed study of these configurations. As far as I know, this is the first complete analysis of the stellar configurations in the <i>Almagest</i>. Nevertheless, some important work has already been done. First and foremost, we have the notes and commentaries in both Manitius’ (1913) and Toomer’s (1984) modern translations. As will become obvious, they served as the main sources on which my work rests, even if it is to –occasionally– criticize them. Secondly, (Pedersen, 2010) and (Evans, 1998), even if they are works with a much wider scope, both provide some important insight into what role the stellar configurations played in Ptolemy’s <i>Almagest</i>.</p>

<p id="p3">The first section of the paper deals with some necessary clarifications regarding the methods I use to evaluate the stellar configurations. After that, the second section goes into the list of Hipparchian configurations that Ptolemy refers in the <i>Almagest</i>. As I said, I will consider the configurations one by one, and accompany each one with the corresponding illustration. In the third section I will do the same with the configurations that Ptolemy presents as his own. The following two sections are a general analysis of the alignments given by both astronomers, and a comparison between some alignments located in the same signs, which could shed some light into the question of the origin of some Ptolemaic alignments.</p>

<h2>Methodological clarifications.</h2>

<p id="p4" class="textindent0">The <i>Almagest</i> indicates various kinds of stellar configurations. From the 26 configurations Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus, 22 are alignments or quasi-alignments between three or four stars. There is one description of an isosceles triangle, one description of two lines being parallel, and two descriptions of a line bisecting another.</p>

<p id="p5">Regarding his own configurations, I counted 23, 21 of which are stellar alignments or quasi alignments. The rest consists of one description of an isosceles triangle, and one of a line bisecting another.</p>

<p id="p6">Hence, by far the majority of the configurations described in the <i>Almagest</i> are descriptions of three or four stars being in the same line, or close to it. This should not come as a surprise, since Ptolemy himself says that he has given the configurations “[…] which are most suitable for easy comprehension and also for giving an overview of the whole method of comparison […]” (Toomer, 1984: 322). The line is, of course, the simplest geometric configuration he could have chosen. Because he is looking at a sphere, we can confidently say that what Ptolemy is referring to when speaking about an <i>εὐθεῖα</i>, is a great circle of that sphere.</p>

<p id="p7">When he describes the alignments, Ptolemy uses different expressions. Many times he indicates that the stars lie on a straight line, in some occasions qualifying the positions as “almost on a straight line”. In other numerous occasions, though, he first points to two stars, and then indicates how far the line they determine passed from a given third star. This distance is never great, at least according to his records. This ambivalence in the expressions used in the descriptions must be considered carefully. The descriptions of a star being at a certain distance from a line determined by two stars can be checked directly. In fact, in (Meeus, 1998: 124) there is a formula for calculating exactly that distance. However, when checking the configurations that the <i>Almagest</i> describes as “straight lines” or “almost straight lines”, one must take into consideration another datum in order to make a fuller assessment of the accuracy of the description.</p>

<figure id="figure-1">
<img alt="" src="images/figure-1.png"/>
<figcaption>Figure 1. In both configurations the middle star, C in the upper example and F in the lower example is at one and the same distance from its corresponding line. However, clearly the upper example has a closer resemblance to a straight line than the lower one.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p8">Refer to <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>. Lines AB and DE represent two lines between pairs of stars. In the first case, a third star C is at a given distance from line AB. This distance is equal to the one between point F to line DE in the second case. However, ACB is more straight-like than CFE. This shows that the distance of the middle star to the line between the two extreme stars cannot, by itself, be a good measure of the accuracy of the description. Instead, I will also measure the angle at the middle star,

</math>

in <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>. To do it, I will use the formula given in (Meeus, 1998: 125).</p>

<p id="p9">The measurement of the distance from the middle star to the line determined by the other two has it place, though. In <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>, if line AB is not great, then it is likely that the distance of C to that line is negligible or very small. But if AB is large, then the distance from C to it may be noticeable. So, even if the angle at C is the same in two different cases, one may be a good alignment and the other one not.</p>

<p id="p10">Because of these ambiguities in what it constitutes a good alignment, in the cases described as “straight lines” or “almost straight lines”, I will give both data. If in some case I depart from this criterion, the reasons will be made clear as needed.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>

<p id="p11">Another difficulty is presented in the case where Ptolemy describes two lines in the celestial sphere as being parallel. Because there are no parallel great circles in spherical geometry, the natural interpretation is that, because the lines he indicates are so short, they can be seen as two straight lines on a plane. So, to analyze that case, I will assume this, and determine the angle at which both lines will intersect in order to determine how close they were to being parallel. The method I used to do that is described in Appendix 1.</p>

<p id="p12">The rest of the configurations offer no special difficulties: in order to analyze the isosceles triangle I simply compare the distances between the apex and the two stars at the base, using the formula given in (Meeus, 1998: 109). Finally, the cases of a line bisecting another are studied by comparing the size of both parts of the bisected line. The method I used to do that is described in Appendix 2.</p>

<p id="p13">I will use as reference Toomer’s identifications of the stars, as indicated in the notes to his translation of the <i>Almagest</i>. In the vast majority of the cases, Toomer follows Manitius’ identifications. So, when I discuss Toomer’s identifications, as a rule the reader should understand that I am referring to an identification by Manitius that Toomer has found satisfactory. In some cases, though, Toomer offers (with various degrees of confidence) alternative identifications. In these instances I have done my best to support one or the other with arguments not found in either work. Finally, in some few cases I offer my own identification (also with various degrees of confidence).</p>

<p id="p14">In all cases, the positions of the stars were computed using the data provided by the <i>Hipparcos Catalogue</i>. Stellar proper motion was accounted for. The years I used as reference for the Hipparchian and Ptolemaic stellar positions are -150 and 140, respectively. The magnitudes of the stars were provided by the <i>Tycho Catalogue</i>.</p>

<p id="p15">The images that go with each configuration were made using <i>Stellarium</i> 0.19.2. There is some variation between the manner in which the <i>Almagest</i> describes the positions of some stars within a given constellation, and how the program depicts them in the constellation drawing. Thus, the images should only be taken as orientative depictions.</p>

<h2>Hipparchus’ configurations.</h2>

<p id="p16" class="textindent0">As I noted in the introduction, Ptolemy presents Hipparchus’ stellar configurations in the context of his exposition on the “so called fixed stars” in <i>Almagest</i> VII 1. There, he tells us that the stars are fixed in the sense that their relative positions remain unchanged through time, but that they are not fixed with respect to the equinoctial points. Both hypotheses are explicitly attributed to Hipparchus, and the chapter is merely intended to serve as a confirmation based on a more secure observational basis. As Ptolemy puts it, “[…] our examination is conducted [with material taken] from a longer time-interval, and because the fixed-star observations recorded by Hipparchus, which are our chief source for comparisons, have been handed down to us in a thoroughly satisfactory form.” (Toomer, 1984: 321).</p>

<p id="p17">The comparison of the stellar positions is aimed at supporting the first of these tenets, that is, that the stars remain fixed in their relative positions. The second one, which he calls the rearward motion of the stars, Hipparchus called the “displacement of the solsticial and equinoctial points” (Toomer, 1984: 327), and is modernly called precession of the equinoxes, will be dealt with in a following section.</p>

<p id="p18">Ptolemy’s text, however, reveals that in the course of his study on the relative positions of the stars Hipparchus changed his mind regarding the extension of their hypothesized relative immobility. When Ptolemy asserts that the stars on the entire celestial sphere are in fixed positions to one another, he says that “This is true not only of the positions of the stars in the zodiac relative to each other, or of the stars outside the zodiac relative to other stars outside the zodiac (<i>which would still be the case if only stars in the vicinity of the zodiac had a rearward motion, as Hipparchus proposes in the first hypothesis he puts forward</i>); but is also true of the positions of stars in the zodiac relative to those outside it, even those at considerable distances.” (Toomer, 1984: 322, italics are mine)</p>

<p id="p19">Ptolemy is implying that Hipparchus initially though that the rearward motion of the stars only affected those within the boundaries of the zodiac. Thus, the relative immobility would only apply within the set of zodiacal stars on the one hand, and within the set of extra zodiacal stars on the other, but not to sets of stars comprised of the two kinds. It is clear that Ptolemy does not hold this position, but instead had understood that all the stars undergo the rearward motion (i.e., a motion in the direction of increasing longitude), and thus that all their relative positions remain unchanged. The fact that he indicates that the former was only “the first hypothesis” Hipparchus had put forward already suggests that Hipparchus himself had, at some point, abandoned it for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of precession. The very fact that Hipparchus’ work about precession was called “On the displacement of the solsticial and equinoctial points” confirms that his final understanding regarding this aspect of the problem was identical to Ptolemy’s: if the objects that moved where those points instead of the stars, then all the stars will move relative to them. As we will see, the Hipparchian alignments Ptolemy quotes confirm this interpretation.</p>

<p id="p20">In the following sections I will provide a study of each of the Hipparchian configurations given in the <i>Almagest</i> with a commentary, and the corresponding images. The order will be the same as the <i>Almagest</i>’s. All positional values will only be given for -150, i.e., the times of Hipparchus.</p>

<h3>Cancer.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p21" style="text-indent:-1em">1) [Hipparchus] records that the star in the southern claw of Cancer, the bright star which is in advance of the latter and of the head of Hydra, and the bright star in Procyon lie almost on a straight line. For the one in the middle lies 1 ½ digits to the north and east of the straight line joining the two end ones, and the distances [from it to each of them] are equal.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p22">Refer to <a href="#illustration01">Illustration 1</a>. Toomer identifies the three stars as <span lang="grc">α</span> Cnc, <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc, and <span lang="grc">α</span> CMi respectively. He notes (322, note 4) that the north-east position cannot be right, and I agree. He calculates that in Hipparchus’ time <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc lay about 5´ to the north-west of the line (Toomer, 1984: 322, note 4). This would give a good coincidence with the 1 ½ digits Ptolemy quotes.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p id="p23">By my calculations, the line was 20.03° long, and <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc lay 25.52´ to the north-west of the line, a considerable difference from the <i>Almagest</i>’s account, and Toomer’s calculations. The distance between <span lang="grc">α</span> Cnc and <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc was 10.6°, while that between <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc and <span lang="grc">α</span> CMi was 9.45°. It should also be noted that already in this first configuration we find a star that is well outside the Zodiac: <span lang="grc">α</span> CMi’s latitude was 15.55° south.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> This already supports the idea that Hipparchus accepted the universal character of the rearward motion of the stars.</p>

<h3>Leo.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p24" style="text-indent:-1em">1) [He records] that the easternmost two of the four stars in the head of Leo, and the star in the place where the neck joins [the head] of Hydra, lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p25">Refer to <a href="#illustration02">Illustration 2</a>. Toomer identifies the first two stars as <span lang="grc">μ</span> Leo and <span lang="grc">ε</span> Leo. The third star in the neck of Hydra is identified by him as <span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya. The <span lang="grc">μ</span> Leo-<span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya line was 23.8° long. The angle at <span lang="grc">ε</span> Leo was 172.9°, and the distance to the <span lang="grc">μ</span> Leo-<span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya line was 18.5´. Although it is not such a good alignment, Toomer has a good reason to identify the third star as <span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya: the description resembles the one in Ptolemy’s catalogue: “[…] the more advanced of the 2 stars in the place where the neck joins [the head] […]” (Toomer, 1984: 392). However, a much better alignment is reached if the third star is identified as <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Hya. Not only does it determine an angle in <span lang="grc">ε</span> Leo of 179.78°, but it also –and crucially– lay just 0.58´ away from the <span lang="grc">μ</span> Leo-<span lang="grc">ζ</span> Hya line, in Hipparchus’ times. If this is the case, then the alignment’s size would not vary much, spanning 24.36° long. Such an identification would go against the natural assumption that the Hipparchian alignments follow the same descriptions for the stars than those given in the Ptolemaic catalogue.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> This variation, however, is not rare: even Ptolemy describes some stars in his own alignments in a different manner as he does in his catalogue (Toomer, 1984: 322, note 3). To conclude, even if I am not sure that the <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Hya alternative is the correct one, it should not be discarded.</p>

<p id="p26">Whatever is the correct option, the stars in this alignment were located at both edges of the Zodiac: the latitudes for <span lang="grc">μ</span> Leo and <span lang="grc">ε</span> Leo were 12.27° north and 9.57° north, respectively, while those of <span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Hya were 11.19° south and 11.14° south, respectively.</p>

<figure id="illustration02">
<img alt="" src="images/illustration02.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration 2. Depiction of the first alignment in Leo. The two lines determined in the figure make it clear that the <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Hya identification gives a much more accurate alignment than the <span lang="grc">ω</span> Hya one.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote><p id="p27">[…] the line drawn through the tail of Leo and the star in the end of the tail of Ursa Major cuts off the bright star under the tail of Ursa Major 1 digit to the west.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p28">Refer to <a href="#illustration03">Illustration 3</a>. These three major stars are identified as <span lang="grc">β</span> Leo, <span lang="grc">η</span> UMa, and <span lang="grc">α</span> CVn, respectively. Toomer calculates (Toomer, 1984: 322, note 8) that the line passed about 30´ from the middle star. By my calculations, it passed 6.54´ away from it, in good agreement with the <i>Almagest</i>’s register.</p>

<p id="p29">The alignment’s size is 42.17°, and it belongs to the set of extra zodiacal stars: while the latitude of <span lang="grc">β</span> Leo was 12.41° north, those of <span lang="grc">η</span> UMa, and <span lang="grc">α</span> CVn were 54.41° north and 40.12° north, respectively.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p30">[…] the line through the star under the tail of Ursa Major and the tail of Leo passes through the more advanced of the stars in Coma.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p31">Refer to <a href="#illustration04">Illustration 4</a>. Toomer identifies (with doubts) the “more advanced” stars as 15 Com and 7 Com. They are indeed, among the brightest stars in a not too bright constellation, the ones that were the closest to the <span lang="grc">β</span> Leo- <span lang="grc">α</span> CVn line: 30.44´ and 44.38´, respectively. Still, it is not a very good alignment.</p>

<p id="p32">The total distance of the line was 27.81°, and the stars were all extra-zodiacal.</p>

<h3>Virgo.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p33" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] between the northern foot of Virgo and the right foot of Bootes lie two stars; the southern one of these, which is equally bright as the [right] foot of Bootes, lies to the east of the line joining the feet, while the northern one, which is half bright, lies on a straight line with the feet.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p34">Refer to <a href="#illustration05">Illustration 5</a>. The two feet are <span lang="grc">μ</span> Vir and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Boo, respectively. Of the two between those, the southern and brightest is 109 Vir (in a slip of the pen Toomer annotated 109 Boo), and the northern one is 31 Boo. As the <i>Almagest</i> says, 109 Vir lies 1.09° to the east of the <span lang="grc">μ</span> Vir-<span lang="grc">ζ</span> Boo line. In modern notation, both <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Boo and 109 Vir have a 3.7 magnitude, so the text seems to be accurate regarding their equal brightnesses. The alignment between the feet and 31 Boo is remarkable: the angle at 31 Boo is 179.6°, and it lay just 1.35´ away from the <span lang="grc">μ</span> Vir-<span lang="grc">ζ</span> Boo line. 31 Boo’s magnitude is 4.9, which means that its apparent brightness is 1/3 that of the 109 Vir’s. Considering the crudeness of the magnitude system used in ancient times, it is not a bad approximation.</p>

<p id="p35">As before, this case shows an alignment of a mixed kind: while <span lang="grc">μ</span> Vir is at the inner edge of the Zodiac with a latitude of 9.99° north, <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Boo is well outside, with a latitude of 28° north. The total distance of the line is 19.2°.</p>

<figure id="illustration05">
<img alt="" src="images/illustration05.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration 5. Unlike the depiction in Stellarium, the <i>Almagest’s</i> description and catalog identifies <span lang="grc">μ</span> Vir as Virgo’s northern foot.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote><p id="p36" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] of these two stars, the half-bright one is preceded by two bright stars, which form, together with the half-bright one, an isosceles triangle of which the half-bright one is the apex.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p37">Refer to <a href="#illustration06">Illustration 6</a>. Manitius identified the two stars at the base as 43 and 46 Boo, in Heis’ catalog (Manitius, 1913: 5). Toomer says that he did not track this identification, “[…] since any identification seems utterly uncertain.” (Toomer, 1984: 323, note 11). I think that Manitius’ identification is correct. Heis’ 43 and 46 Boo (Heis, 88) are our modern HIP 70327 and HIP 70400. Although they are by no means bright (mags. 4.8 and 4.15 respectively), they are the brightest in the region by a considerable margin, and clearly resemble, together with 31 Boo, an isosceles triangle. The distance from 31 Boo to HIP 70327 was 4.49°, and the distance from 31 Boo the HIP 70400 was 4.89°, with a difference of 24´ between the sides of the triangle. The size of the triangle’s base was 2.64°. The three stars are well outside the Zodiac, with northern latitudes close to 20°.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p38" style="text-indent:-1em">3) These [two bright stars] lie on a straight line with Arcturus and the southern foot of Virgo.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p39">Refer to <a href="#illustration07">Illustration 7</a>. This alignment is doubtful. Toomer identifies the southern foot of Virgo with <span lang="grc">λ</span> Vir, following the description in the <i>Almagest</i>’s catalog. Arcturus, HIP 70327 and HIP 70400 form a good alignment, with the angle at HIP 70327 being 178.44°, and HIP 70327 lying 3.55´ away from the Arcturus-HIP 70400 line. However, these do not align so well with <span lang="grc">λ</span> Vir. The angle Arcturus-HIP 70400-<span lang="grc">λ</span> Vir is 170.48°, and HIP 70400 lay 1.42° away from the Arcturus- <span lang="grc">λ</span> Vir line, which is 33.77° long. Despite these problems, for the moment Toomer’s identification is the best extant option. These identifications would render the alignment as one of a mixed kind: while <span lang="grc">λ</span> Vir is almost on the ecliptic with a latitude of 0.62° north, Arcturus had a latitude of 32.17° north.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p40" style="text-indent:-1em">4) […] between Spica and the second star from the end of the tail in Hydra lie three stars, all on one straight line. The middle one of these lies on a straight line with Spica and the second star from the end of the tail in Hydra.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p41">Refer to <a href="#illustration08">Illustration 8</a>. Toomer corrects Manitius, who had identified the three stars as 61, 63, 69 Vir. He proposes, 57 Vir instead of 61 Vir, which is plausible. Such an identification would give an angle at the middle star, 63 Vir, of 172.05°, with 63 Vir lying 9.92´ away from the 57 Vir-69 Vir line. Another possibility is the trio 53, 63, 73 Vir. That identification would give an angle at 63 Vir of 173.48°, and a distance of 63 Vir to the 53 Vir-73 Vir line of 9.33´. Whatever the case, it seems likely that the middle star is 63 Vir, which the text tells us was aligned with Spica and the second star from the end of Hydra’s tail, i.e, <span lang="grc">γ</span> Hya. The angle at 63 Vir for that alignment was 174.09°, and 63 Vir lay 18.66´ away from the Spica- <span lang="grc">γ</span> Hya line. The entire line was 12.1° long. All the stars discussed here were within the Zodiac, with the exception of 57 Vir (lat. 10.92° south) and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Hya (lat. 13.62° south).</p>

<h3>Libra.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p42" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the star which is very nearly on a straight line towards the north with the [two] bright stars in the claws is bright and triple: for on both sides of it lie single small stars.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p43">Refer to <a href="#illustration09">Illustration 9</a>. Toomer corrects Manitius’ identification, and proposes <span lang="grc">μ</span> Ser instead of <span lang="grc">α</span> Ser as the star aligned with <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Lib. This correction is completely justified. The two small stars are 30 and 36 Ser. The line <span lang="grc">α</span> Lib-<span lang="grc">μ</span> Ser was 19.15° long. The angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Lib was 168.97°, with a distance of 55.89´ to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Lib-<span lang="grc">μ</span> Ser line. As the text indicates the alignment is, truly, just approximate. While <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Lib were obviously within the Zodiac, <span lang="grc">μ</span> Ser had a latitude of 16.47° north.</p>

<h3>Scorpius.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p44" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the straight line drawn through the rearmost of the stars in the sting of Scorpius and through the right knee of Ophiuchus bisects the interval between the two advance stars in the right foot of Ophiuchus […]</p></blockquote>

<p id="p45">Refer to <a href="#illustration10">Illustration 10</a>. Toomer’s identification of the four stars seems undisputable: <span lang="grc">λ</span> Sco for the sting, <span lang="grc">η</span> Oph for the knee, and the pair of <span lang="grc">θ</span> Oph and 36 Oph for the stars in the right foot. The bisecting line <span lang="grc">λ</span> Sco-<span lang="grc">η</span> Oph had a size of 21.92°, and the bisected one, <span lang="grc">θ</span> Oph-36 Oph, was 1.56° long. In this last one, the section on the side of  <span lang="grc">θ</span> Oph had a size of 0.65°, and that on the side of 36 Oph had a size of 0.91°, with a difference of 15.48´ and a ratio of 0.72 between them. With the exception of <span lang="grc">λ</span> Sco (lat. 13.53° south), all of the stars were zodiacal.</p>

<p id="p47">Refer to <a href="#illustration11">Illustration 11</a>. The identification by Toomer of the three stars as <span lang="grc">θ</span> Sco, <span lang="grc">κ</span> Sco, and <span lang="grc">α</span> Ara is certain. The total size of the alignment is 10.98°, and all of the stars were extra-zodiacal, with southern latitudes of 19.4°, 15.38° and 26.28°, respectively. The angle at <span lang="grc">θ</span> Sco was 172.98°, and that star lay 18.94´ away from the <span lang="grc">κ</span> Sco-<span lang="grc">α</span> Ara.</p>

<p id="p49">Refer to <a href="#illustration12">Illustration 12</a>. This alignment was probably detected when determining the previous one. Toomer’s identification of the star at the base as <span lang="grc">σ</span> Ara (lat. 22.9° south) is certain. The alignment was, as the text indicates, only approximate: the angle at <span lang="grc">σ</span> Ara was 174.39°, and it lay 10.15´ away from the <span lang="grc">θ</span> Sco-<span lang="grc">α</span> Ara line, which was 6.9° long. The distances from <span lang="grc">σ</span> Ara to <span lang="grc">θ</span> Sco and to <span lang="grc">α</span> Ara were 3.5° and 3.41°, respectively. This is a difference of only 5.09´, and the stars were all extra-zodiacal.</p>

<h3>Sagittarius.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p50" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] to the east and south of the Circle under Sagittarius lie two bright stars, quite some distance (about 3 cubits) from each other. The southernmost and brighter of these, which is on the foot of Sagittarius, lies very nearly on a straight line with the midmost of the three bright stars in the Circle (which lie furthest towards the east in that [constellation], and with the rearmost of the two bright stars at opposite angles of the Quadrilateral: the two intervals are equal.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p51">Refer to <a href="#illustration13">Illustration 13</a>. Toomer’s identification of the two stars “to the east and south of the Circle” as <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Sgr is certain, as is that of the other two as <span lang="grc">α</span> CrA and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr. The only ambiguity lies in the fact that there are two stars at the foot of Sagittarius, and not one: <span lang="grc">β</span><sup>1</sup> and <span lang="grc">β</span><sup>2</sup> Sgr. They were distanced by a considerable 19.76´. The general direction of the line they determine, however, is similar to that of the alignment under study, so the choice between one of these two does not have a notable effect in the final measurements. I will choose <span lang="grc">β</span><sup>1</sup> Sgr, simply because it is the brightest of the two. The text says that <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Sgr are separated by “about 2 cubits”. By my calculations, the distance was in fact 3.9°. If we assume a value of 2° or 2.5° for a cubit, then the <i>Almagest</i>’s estimation is about right.</p>

<p id="p52">The angle at <span lang="grc">α</span> CrA was 170.49°, and this star lay 37.69´ away from the <span lang="grc">β</span><sup>1</sup> Sgr- <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr line. Thus, the alignment (which was 15.08° long), is a very poor one. With the exception of <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr (lat. 6.94° south), the stars were extra-zodiacal.</p>

<p id="p53">The text also adds that the intervals are equal. I find that the distances from <span lang="grc">α</span> CrA to <span lang="grc">β</span><sup>1</sup> Sgr and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr were 7.06° and 8.08°, respectively. This means a variation of 1.02°, and a ratio of 1.14.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p54" style="text-indent:-1em">2) The northernmost [of the two stars to the east of the Circle] lies to the east of this straight line, but is on a straight line with the [two] bright stars at opposite angles of the Quadrilateral.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p55">Refer to <a href="#illustration13">Illustration 13</a>. This alignment is very close to the previous one. The identification of the third star as <span lang="grc">σ</span> Sgr is mandatory. The angle at <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr was 175.81°, with a distance of that star to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Sgr- <span lang="grc">σ</span> Sgr line of 12.99´. The entire alignment was 15.46° long. While <span lang="grc">σ</span> and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Sgr were zodiacal, <span lang="grc">α</span> Sgr’s latitude was 18.07° south.</p>

<h3>Aquarius.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p56" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the two stars close together in the head of Pegasus and the rear shoulder of Aquarius are almost on a straight line, to which the line from the advance shoulder of Aquarius to the star in the cheek of Pegasus is parallel.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p57">Refer to <a href="#illustration14">Illustration 14</a>. The three stars in the alignment are identified by Toomer as <span lang="grc">θ</span> and <span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg, and <span lang="grc">α</span> Aqr (lats. 16.48° north,15.76° north, and 10.78° north respectively). The other two stars, as <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr and <span lang="grc">ε</span> Peg (lats. 8.77° north and 22.22° north, respectively). The identifications are certain. The alignment is extremely poor. The angle at <span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg was 138.47°, and that star lay 50.24´ away from the <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aqr line. Curiously, <span lang="grc">θ</span> and <span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg form a very good alignment with <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr, the “advance shoulder” of Aquarius: in this case the angle at <span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg is 178.12°, and that star lay just 2.75´ away from the <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr line. Given that <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr is mentioned afterwards in the same description, is it possible that in the original Hipparchian list of configurations there were two distinct descriptions that used the same stars, and that these were later conflated into one description in a confused way?</p>

<p id="p58">The alleged parallelism between the two indicated lines <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aqr (6.56° long), and <span lang="grc">ε</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr (15.76° long) is notably good, assuming that we are looking at a plane and not a sphere.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> On the one hand, <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg is 6.92° away from the <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr-<span lang="grc">ε</span> Peg line. On the other, the distance of <span lang="grc">α</span> Aqr to the same line is 7.34°. Given the sizes of the lines, this means that they will cross at an angle of 3.66°. So, their disposition bears a great resemblance to parallelism.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p59" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the advance shoulder of Aquarius, the bright star of the two in the neck of Pegasus, and the star in the navel of Pegasus lie on a straight line, with equal intervals between them.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p60">Refer to <a href="#illustration15">Illustration 15</a>. There are no reasons to dispute the identifications of the stars as <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr, <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg and <span lang="grc">α</span> And. It was a fairly big alignment, spanning 51.2° long the night sky. The angle at <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg was 177.22°, with a distance of 39.8´ from <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg to the <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr-<span lang="grc">α</span> And line. It can be noted that the other, dimmer, star “in the neck of Pegasus”, <span lang="grc">ξ</span> Peg, determines a better alignment: the angle was 178.67°, and the distance to the <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr-<span lang="grc">α</span> And line was 19.12´. As the text points out, though, <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg is much brighter<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>, which explains that it was the one used as reference.</p>

<p id="p61">Regarding the distances from <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg, the value to <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr was 23.89°, and to <span lang="grc">α</span> And, 27.33°. The difference was 3.44°, with a ratio of 1.14. Again, <span lang="grc">ξ</span> Peg gives a better equivalence in the distances, with a value of 25.87° for the distance to <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr, and 25.33° to <span lang="grc">α</span> And. In this case, the difference is just 32.57´, with a ratio of 1.02. However, the identifications are, as I said, certain, and given that the improvement is not qualitative, it is reasonable to assume that the superior brightness of <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Peg explains why it was chosen over <span lang="grc">ξ</span> Peg. With the exception of <span lang="grc">β</span> Aqr, all the stars were extra-zodiacal.</p>

<p id="p63">Refer to <a href="#illustration16">Illustration 16</a>. The four stars are identified with certainty as <span lang="grc">ε</span> Peg, <span lang="grc">η</span> Aqr, <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg and <span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg.

The identification of the stars as <span lang="grc">β</span> Psc, <span lang="grc">α</span> Peg and <span lang="grc">β</span> Peg is certain.

The size of the alignment was 24.17°. The set of stars is of a mixed kind: while <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Peg had latitudes of 19.47° north and 31.11° north, respectively, <span lang="grc">β</span> Psc was just within the Zodiac, with a latitude of 9.1° north.</p>

<h3>Aries.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p67" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the advance star in the base of Triangulum lies 1 digit to the east of the straight line drawn through the star in the muzzle of Aries and the left foot of Andromeda.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p68">Refer to <a href="#illustration18">Illustration 18</a>. Toomer (324, note 26) says that “There is no doubt about the identification of the stars” as <span lang="grc">β</span> Tri, <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari and <span lang="grc">γ</span> And. He is right. He also indicates that the <i>Almagest</i>’s distance of one digit is too low, and says that he has calculated that <span lang="grc">β</span> Tri lay “[…] well over a degree to the east of the line connecting <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari and <span lang="grc">γ</span> And”. By my calculations, the distance was 50.29´ in Hipparchus’ time.</p>

<p id="p69">The quasi-alignment was 18.82° long, and of a mixed kind: the southernmost of its stars, <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari, had a latitude of 9.93° north. The one in the Triangulum and the one in Andromeda were extra-zodiacal, with latitudes of 20.46° and 27.67°, respectively.</p>

<figure id="illustration18">
<img alt="" src="images/illustration18.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration17"/>18. Depiction of the quasi-alignment between Aries, Triangulum and Andromeda.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote><p id="p70" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the most advanced of the stars in the head of Aries and the midpoint of the base of Triangulum lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p71">Refer to <a href="#illustration19">Illustration 19</a>. In this case, Toomer proposes two possibilities. The first, which is Manitius’, identifies the stars in Aries as <span lang="grc">β</span> and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Ari, and the “midpoint of the base of Triangulum” as the middle point between <span lang="grc">β</span> and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Tri. The second is presented by Toomer himself (1984: 324, note 27), and identifies the stars in Aries as <span lang="grc">λ</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari, and the midpoint as a star, <span lang="grc">δ</span> Tri. Given that in his catalog Ptolemy puts <span lang="grc">γ</span> Ari “on the horn” of Aries (Toomer, 1984: 360), it is possible that Hipparchus had done the same. If this is the case, then it would not be “in the head”, and <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari would take its place as the most advanced in the head, followed by <span lang="grc">λ</span> Ari.</p>

<p id="p72">While Toomer (albeit with doubts) ultimately favoured Manitius’ identification over this second possibility, I think that his alternative idea is actually correct. Not only it is much better than he seems to realize (he qualifies the alignment it determines as “approximate”), but Manitius’ is much worse.</p>

<p id="p73">Manitius’ <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">γ</span> Ari line passes way off the middle point between <span lang="grc">β</span> and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Tri. In fact, it passed 41.12´ to the west of <span lang="grc">β</span> Tri, the most advanced of the stars at the base of Triangulum. Toomer’s alternative is much better. Because of the fact that <span lang="grc">δ</span> Tri has a high proper motion<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-8" href="#footnote-8">8</a></sup>, it is very helpful to have modern satellite data to calculate a good estimate of its position over 21 centuries ago. In this case, the angle at the middle star, <span lang="grc">λ</span> Ari, was 179.47°. For comparison with the previous alternative, in this case the <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari- <span lang="grc">λ</span> Ari line passed just 6.25´ to the east of <span lang="grc">δ</span> Tri.</p>

<p id="p74">Assuming the “Toomer alternative”, the alignment was 14.19° long, and it was of a mixed kind. While <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari was zodiacal (lat. 8.43° north) and <span lang="grc">λ</span> Ari was right in the limit (lat. 10.68° north), <span lang="grc">δ</span> Tri (lat. 19.49° north) was well outside the Zodiac.</p>

<figure id="illustration19">
<img alt="" src="images/illustration19.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration18"/>19. Depiction of the alignment between Aries and Triangulum. Because the positions of β Ari and λ Ari have remained virtually the same, the slow motion of δ Tri towards the east caused that when Ptolemy checked the alignment (if he checked at all) δ Tri was barely 2.5´ to the west of the β Ari-λ Ari line, a coincidence indistinguishable from a perfectly straight line.</figcaption>

<h3>Taurus.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p75" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the [two] easternmost stars of the Hyades and that star in the pelt held in Orion´s left hand which is sixth, counted from the south, lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p76">Refer to <a href="#illustration20">Illustration 20</a>. This alignment is a fairly good one. Toomer’s identification of the stars as <span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau, <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, and <span lang="grc">π</span><sup>1</sup> Ori is correct. Both stars in Taurus were zodiacal, but <span lang="grc">π</span><sup>1</sup> Ori was outside, with a latitude of 12.52° south. The alignment was 11.01° long. The angle at <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau was 177.58°, and that star lay 5.68´ away from the <span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau-<span lang="grc">π</span><sup>1</sup> Ori line.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p77" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the line drawn through the advance eye of Taurus and the seventh star from the south in the pelt cuts off the bright star in the Hyades 1 digit to the north.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p78">Refer to <a href="#illustration21">Illustration 21</a>. There is no doubt that the “bright star in the Hyades” is <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau. It seems certain, as well, that the star in the pelt is <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori. Manitius (Manitius, 1913: 8) identifies the star in the “advance eye of Taurus” as <span lang="grc">δ</span> Tau, presumably our <span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>1</sup> Tau. Toomer challenges this last identification, proposing that we should instead prefer <span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau. He gives two reasons for this (Toomer, 1984: 324, note 29): first, that the description for <span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau in Ptolemy’s star catalog puts it as being “on the northern eye”, while <span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>1</sup> Tau is “the one between this [<span lang="grc">γ</span> Tau] and the northern eye”. The second reason is that he calculates that the <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori-<span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>1</sup> Tau line passed about 1° to the north of <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, while the <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori- <span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau passed about 8´ to the north, much closer to the <i>Almagest</i>’s description.</p>

<p id="p79">There are several things to point out in this case. First that the <i>Almagest</i>’s expression is indicating that the line is passing to the south of <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, not the north. Also, by my calculations the <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori-<span lang="grc">ε</span> Tau line passed, in Hipparchus’ times, 53.18´ to the north of <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, and not the 8´ calculated by Toomer. Manitius’ identification is indeed better. The <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori-<span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>1</sup> Tau line passed to the south of <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau (as the <i>Almagest</i> says). The distance is also better, being 30.09´ away from the line.</p>

<p id="p80">However, it is possible that neither of those stars was the one referenced by the text. While the Hipparchian description distinguishes the eyes in Taurus as being one “the easternmost” and the other the “more advanced”, Ptolemy’s catalog describes them as being “the southern” and “the northern” (Toomer, 1984: 362). This allows for us to suspect that there could be small variations in the details of their respective constellation drawings, at least regarding the Hyades. If we assume that the description of the alignment is referring to <span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>3</sup> Tau, a star that is not in Ptolemy’s catalog but that is nevertheless quite bright (mag. 4.32), then we obtain that the <span lang="grc">ο</span><sup>2</sup> Ori-<span lang="grc">δ</span><sup>3</sup> Tau passed 5.42´ to the south of <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, almost precisely the value given in the <i>Almagest</i>.</p>

<p id="p81">If this is the case, the alignment was 8.73° long. All the stars were zodiacal.</p>

<h3>Gemini.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p82" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the heads of Gemini lie on a straight line with a certain star which lies to the rear of the rearmost head by a distance three times that between the heads […]</p></blockquote>

<p id="p83">Refer to <a href="#illustration22">Illustration 22</a>. The identification of the two heads of Gemini as <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem is beyond doubt. Toomer’s identification of the third as <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Cnc is also certain. The alignment is very good, with an angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem of 178.62°, and a distance of 4.9´ to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Gem- <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Cnc line. The alignment was 16.52° long, and all the stars were within the boundaries of the Zodiac.</p>

<p id="p84">The distance between the two heads of Gemini was 4.67°, and that between <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem and <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Cnc was 11.85°. This is a ratio of 2.54, not so far from the 3 indicated by the text.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p85" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the same star [i.e., <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Cnc] also lies on a straight line with the [two] southernmost of the four stars round the nebula [Praesepe].</p></blockquote>

<p id="p86">Refer to <a href="#illustration22">Illustration 22</a>. These last two stars are identified with certainty as <span lang="grc">θ</span> and <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc. The alignment is quite good, with an angle at <span lang="grc">θ</span> Cnc of 179.49°, and a distance of 0.99´ to the <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc- <span lang="grc">ζ</span> Cnc line. It was a small alignment, just 7.77° long. All the stars were zodiacal.</p>

<h2>Ptolemy’s configurations.</h2>

<p id="p87" class="textindent0">Ptolemy relates, after giving the Hipparchian list, that he has compared the descriptions left by Hipparchus with the layout of the stars in his own times, and that he has found that “[…] no change has occurred up to the present time.” (Toomer, 1984: 325). This supports the idea that precession affects the entirety of the celestial sphere, and not just the zodiacal belt. However, so as to allow his successors to make new comparisons through longer time intervals, he gives a new list of configurations “[…] which were not previously recorded.”</p>

<p id="p88">In the following section, I will continue with the analysis as I have done with the Hipparchian cases.</p>

<h3>Aries.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p89" style="text-indent:-1em">1) The two northernmost of the three stars in the head of Aries and the bright star in the southern knee of Perseus and the star called Capella lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p90">Refer to <a href="#illustration23">Illustration 23</a>. An independent identification of the two stars in Aries is not so simple, since the description of the stars here does not fit easily into the way he describes the constellation in the catalog. It is certain that the southern knee of Perseus is <span lang="grc">ε</span> Per. Toomer prefers <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari for the stars in Aries, and given the good alignment they produce there is no good reason to dispute this identification.  This alignment was quite big, spanning 48.07° long the night sky. On the one hand, the angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">α</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aur was 179.53°, with a distance of 1.82´ from <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari to the <span lang="grc">β</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aur line. On the other, the angle <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">ε</span> Per-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aur was 176.93°, and there was a distance of 34´ from <span lang="grc">ε</span> Per to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Ari-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aur line.</p>

<h3>Taurus.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p91" style="text-indent:-1em">1) The line drawn through the star called Capella and the bright star in the Hyades cuts off the star in the advance leg of Auriga a little to the east.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p92">Refer to <a href="#illustration23">Illustration 23</a>. The identification of the bright star in the Hyades as <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, and of Auriga’s knee as <span lang="grc">ι</span> Aur is certain. The distance from <span lang="grc">ι</span> Aur to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aur line was 22.95´. The entire alignment was 30.8° long.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-9" href="#footnote-9">9</a></sup></p>

<figure id="illustration23">

<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration22"/>23. Depiction of the alignments in Aries and Taurus.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote><p id="p93" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the star called Capella, the star which is common to the rearmost foot of Auriga and the tip of the northern horn of Taurus, and the star in the advance shoulder of Orion lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p94">Refer to <a href="#illustration24">Illustration 24</a>. There is no doubt that the star shared by Taurus and Auriga is <span lang="grc">β</span> Tau. Toomer also identifies “the advance shoulder of Orion” as <span lang="grc">γ</span> Ori, a star which the catalog describes as “the left shoulder of Orion” (Toomer, 1984: 383). So, it is almost certain that this is the correct identification, even if <span lang="grc">λ</span> Ori (probably “the nebulous star in the head of Orion”, in Ptolemy’s catalog) determines a much better alignment. The angle <span lang="grc">α</span> Aur-<span lang="grc">β</span> Tau-<span lang="grc">γ</span> Ori was 173.73°, and <span lang="grc">β</span> Tau was 1.12° away from the <span lang="grc">α</span> Aur-<span lang="grc">γ</span> Ori line. The entire alignment was 39.9° long.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-10" href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup></p>

<h3>Gemini.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p95" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the two bright stars in the heads of Gemini and the bright star in the neck of Hydra lie very nearly on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p96">Refer to <a href="#illustration25">Illustration 25</a>. Toomer follows Manitius in identifying “the bright star in the neck of Hydra” as <span lang="grc">θ</span> Hya. However, given that Ptolemy describes <span lang="grc">κ</span> Hya as being “after the bend” <i>in the neck</i> of Hydra (Toomer, 1984: 392; emphasis mine), I think that he was referring to <span lang="grc">α</span> Hya. This option would not only give a much better alignment, but it would also justify him calling the star “bright”: while Toomer’s identification would give an angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem of 168.83° and a distance of 48.2´ to the <span lang="grc">α</span> Gem-<span lang="grc">θ</span> Hya line, my identification would give an angle of 174.63°, and a distance of 24.13´. Assuming my identification, the alignment was 48.73° long, while Toomer’s and Manitius’ was 37.59°.</p>

<h3>Cancer.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p97" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the two stars close together in the front leg of Ursa Major, the star on the tip of the northern claw of Cancer, and the northernmost of the ´Aselli´ lie on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p98">Refer to <a href="#illustration26">Illustration 26</a>. The identification of the four stars is certain: <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa, <span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa, <span lang="grc">ι</span> Cnc and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Cnc, respectively. Toomer rightfully points out that the alignment would have been good (“more plausible”) had Ptolemy removed <span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa from the configuration (Toomer, 1984: 325, note 36). As Toomer suggests, given that <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa is to the north of <span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa, the original should have indicated the extreme of the alignment not as being comprised of the “two stars close together”, but of “the northernmost of the two stars close together”. Because the text uses the term “northern” or “northernmost” several times in the description, in my opinion it is likely that at some early stage in the textual tradition the hypothesized “northernmost” in the Ursa Major section was lost due to a natural confusion on the part of the copyist.</p>

<p id="p99">The unlikeliness of the present text representing the original Ptolemaic description can be assessed by looking at the angles it produces: the <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa-<span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa-<span lang="grc">ι</span> Cnc angle was 136.75°, and <span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa was 44.93´ away from the <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa-<span lang="grc">ι</span> Cnc line. These are very bad results, even for a crude estimation.</p>

<p id="p100">If we ignore <span lang="grc">κ</span> UMa, we get an angle <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa-<span lang="grc">ι</span> Cnc-<span lang="grc">γ</span> Cnc of 179.22°, and a distance of <span lang="grc">ι</span> Cnc to the <span lang="grc">ι</span> UMa-<span lang="grc">γ</span> Cnc line of 4.42´. The entire alignment was 26.87° long.</p>

<blockquote><p id="p101" style="text-indent:-1em">2) […] the southern Asellus, the bright star in Procyon, and the bright star between them (which is in advance of the head of Hydra), lie almost on a straight line.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p102">Refer to <a href="#illustration27">Illustration 27</a>. The identification as <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc, <span lang="grc">α</span> CMi, and <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc, is certain. The alignment is not particularly good, even for an “almost” straight line. The angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc was 146.82°, and the distance of that star to the <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc-<span lang="grc">α</span> CMi line was 3°. The alignment spanned 20° long the night sky.</p>

<p id="p103">A possible explanation is that Ptolemy was not originally referring to Procyon, but to Sirius. The <i>Almagest</i> indicates the star as being <i>ὁ</i><i></i> <i>ἐν</i><i></i> <i>τῷ</i><i> Πρόκυνι</i> (Heiberg, vol II, 9). If the original instead read <i>ὁ</i><i></i> <i>ἐν</i><i></i> <i>τῷ</i><i> κῠνί</i>, “the one in the dog”, then it would be indicating <span lang="grc">α</span> CMa, and the alignment would be much better. Ptolemy’s catalog calls Sirius “the Dog” (Toomer, 1984: 387). The name Procyon literally means <i>before</i> or <i>in front of, the dog</i>. Given the similar names and their associations, and since they are in the same general direction, a confusion by the copyist cannot be discarded. As we will see in the last section, a comparison between Ptolemy’s and Hipparchus’ alignments in Cancer may provide additional support for this option. If this is the case, it would be one of just three mentions to Sirius in the entire <i>Almagest</i>.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-11" href="#footnote-11">11</a></sup> By my calculations, in this case the angle at <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc was 174.61°, and the distance of that star to the <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc-<span lang="grc">α</span> CMa line was 49.89´. The entire alignment would have been 45.06°.</p>

<h3>Leo.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p104" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the straight line drawn from the midmost star of the bright stars in the neck of Leo to the bright star in Hydra cuts off the star on the heart of Leo a little to the east.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p105">Refer to <a href="#illustration28">Illustration 28</a>. Toomer’s identification of the stars as <span lang="grc">γ</span> Leo, <span lang="grc">α</span> Hya and <span lang="grc">α</span> Leo is certain. The line passed 1.06° to the west of <span lang="grc">α</span> Leo, and was 31.3° long.</p>

<p id="p107">Refer to <a href="#illustration29">Illustration 29</a>.

The <span lang="grc">δ</span> Leo-<span lang="grc">γ</span> UMa was 33.96° long, and passed 1.3° to the east of <span lang="grc">ν</span> UMa, and 56.79´ to the east of <span lang="grc">ξ</span> UMa.</p>

It should be noted that while Toomer and Manitius (Manitius, 1913: 10) only refer to the two stars I mentioned, it is possible that Ptolemy was thinking of a set of three: <span lang="grc">η</span>, <span lang="grc">δ</span> and <span lang="grc">γ</span> Crv. Not only is <span lang="grc">η</span> Crv described in Ptolemy’s catalog as the “the rearmost of the two stars in the rear wing” (Toomer, 1984: 394), but is also forms a good alignment with the other two stars in Corvus.</p>

<p id="p123">Refer to <a href="#illustration36">Illustration 36</a>.

The angle at <span lang="grc">υ</span> Sco was 176.73°, and distance of that star to the <span lang="grc">θ</span> Sco-<span lang="grc">ξ</span> Oph line of 14.89´.</p>

<p id="p129">Refer to <a href="#illustration37">Illustration 37</a>.

<h3>Capricorn.</h3>

<blockquote><p id="p130" style="text-indent:-1em">1) […] the line drawn from the bright star in Lyra to the stars in the horns of Capricorn cuts of the bright star in Aquila a little to the east.</p></blockquote>

<p id="p131">Refer to <a href="#illustration38">Illustration 38</a>. The stars in Lyra and Aquila are, with certainty, Vega and <span lang="grc">α</span> Aql. Toomer gives good reasons (Toomer, 1984: 326, note 44) to identify “the stars in the horns of Capricorn” not as <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Cap, but as the general direction of <span lang="grc">α</span>, <span lang="grc">β</span>, <span lang="grc">ν</span>, and <span lang="grc">ξ</span> Cap, i.e., the stars that Ptolemy locates in the horns in his catalog (Toomer, 1984: 375). I am not convinced that Ptolemy would give such a vague reference in his description of the alignment. However, I am not able to give any further argument other than the fact that this is not what he did in any other case.</p>

<p id="p132">For the analysis I will use as a reference <span lang="grc">β</span> Cap, simply because its direction is approximately in the center of this set of stars. Assuming this, the alignment would have been 58.74° long. The <span lang="grc">β</span> Cap-Vega line passed 2.07° to the west of <span lang="grc">α</span> Aql.</p>

<h2>General analysis.</h2>

<p id="p139" class="textindent0">The first thing that strikes the scholar when comparing both lists of stellar configurations is the fact that Hipparchus’ begins in Cancer, while Ptolemy’ does so in Aries. It may be that this variation has no special meaning.  However, a possible reason for Hipparchus to put the origin of the list in the summer point rather that in the vernal point may lie in the fact that he used the Kallippic Cycle<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-14" href="#footnote-14">14</a></sup> as the main reference for dating astronomical observations. Now, the First Kallippic Cycle began with the summer solstice of -329, so this may be an indication that his epoch had, at least in this respect, a greater significance.</p>

<p id="p140">In my study of the Hipparchian configurations I have noted the zodiacal or extra-zodiacal nature of the stars that determine them. As Evans suggests (Evans, 1998: 259) it may very well be the case that Hipparchus’ discovery of precession came while developing his lunar model. In fact, Ptolemy says (Toomer, 1984: 327) that Hipparchus used, as a reference for comparison, the longitude of Spica Timocharis had obtained during a lunar eclipse. Even if Timocharis had used the distance between Spica and the moon as a way of determining the position of the moon, Hipparchus could reverse the method. Given that he had an accurate solar model, he could determine the position of the moon independently, and thus obtain the longitude of Spica at the time of Timocharis. Because the previous reference for stellar positions was the moon, Hipparchus must not have had many positions of extra-zodiacal stars which he could use to check the extent of the precession phenomenon. Thus, his research on this question must have been tentative.</p>

<p id="p141">However, when we look at the list of configurations Ptolemy preserved in the <i>Almagest</i>, we can see that Ptolemy’s suggestion that Hipparchus ended up concluding that precession was universal was certainly grounded in Hipparchus’ research. Out of the 24 sets of stars<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-15" href="#footnote-15">15</a></sup> he uses in the configurations that have come down to us, 14 are of a mixed nature. The rest are equally divided: 5 are sets of all extra-zodiacal stars, and 5 are sets of all zodiacal ones. In fact, almost 6 out of 10 of the stars the configurations refer to had a latitude greater than ± 10°. If Ptolemy’s is a list which is representative of the original work, then it seems that Hipparchus made sure to cover all the possibilities in his research.</p>

<p id="p142">But, as we saw, Ptolemy’s role is not limited to recounting some of his predecessor’s configurations, and checking them in his own times. In a bold move, Ptolemy recognizes the possibility that proper stellar motion may be so slow that even the period between himself and Hipparchus is not enough to detect a variation in their relative positions. His list of configurations is thus given as supplementary material for future astronomers to check this feature. One the one hand, this shows us a rather modern approach on Ptolemy’s part. On the other, we should not overestimate the importance of this addendum, because Ptolemy had shown that, if the fixed stars were in fact not fixed and had a proper motion, the speed of this motion was so slow that it would not affect the accuracy of his planetary models. He could trust that both the ancient observations he had received<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-16" href="#footnote-16">16</a></sup> and the predictions his theories could deliver in the foreseeable future would fit well in his model of the cosmos, <i>even if there was in fact some kind of proper motion</i>. If some future astronomer found this, only minor modifications would be needed to correct his work.</p>

<p id="p143">As Evans points out, though, these considerations were probably not at the center of Ptolemy’s preocupations when composing this section of the <i>Almagest</i>:</p>

<p id="p144"><i>“For Hipparchus it was still an open question whether the precession was confined to the zodiac stars or shared by the whole sphere. […] By Ptolemy’s time the issue had been settled. Ptolemy’s aim was simply to give his readers a number of easily checked rough alignments involving bright and familiar stars.”</i> (Evans, 1998: 250)</p>

<p id="p145">As in many other sections of the <i>Almagest</i>, it is likely that Ptolemy is here just offering enough observational evidence to justify going forward in his theoretical constructions without leaving any relevant issue (like the fixedness of the stars) untouched. In this sense, this section is there mainly due to its didactical importance. That explains that Ptolemy used brighter stars: the average magnitude of the stars Hipparchus used was 3.41, with a standard deviation of 1.45.<sup><a class="footnote-reference" id="footnote-reference-17" href="#footnote-17">17</a></sup> In contrast, Ptolemy’s stars had an average magnitude of 2.5, with a standard deviation of 1.14. This means that the average Ptolemaic star was 2.3 times brighter than the average Hipparchian one. This criterion of brightness likely forced Ptolemy to make his alignments much larger: while the average size for Hipparchus was 19.94° (stand. dev. 11.5), Ptolemy’s was almost double, with a value of 39.94° (stand. dev. 16.87).</p>

<p id="p146">However, an analysis of the alignments shows that Ptolemy’s alignments were not “[…] somewhat sloppy […] (Evans, 1998: 250) when compared to Hipparchus’. If we look at the cases which the astronomers described as being “straight lines” without any further qualification (15 for Hipparchus and 13 for Ptolemy, if we don´t count the exceptionally bad case in Hipparchus’ first alignment in Aquarius, <span lang="grc">θ</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">ν</span> Peg-<span lang="grc">α</span> Aqr), we find that the average error in the angle at the middle star was 3.5° for Hipparchus (stand. dev. 2.98), and 2.21° for Ptolemy (stand. dev. 1.74). The distances of the middle stars to the line determined by the extreme ones were 21.42´ (stand. dev. 22.9) for Hipparchus, and 25.22´ (stand. dev. 24.34) for Ptolemy. These results indicate that both astronomers, when pointing at alignments as if they were very close to being perfect lines, produced results with very similar errors.</p>

<p id="p147">Many alignments are nevertheless qualified in various ways, as we have seen. Table 1 shows how these different quasi-alignments were given for Hipparchus.</p>

<p id="p148">I have no answer as to how Hipparchus could give such a bad estimate in the cases of Aries and Cancer. While the cases for Taurus and Leo are very good approximations to the 1 digit value, the other two are off by several digits.</p>

<p id="p149">The cases of approximate alignments are much better. We can see that an approximate alignment was, for Hipparchus, one that was close to 170°. Given that there is a big variation in how that angle relates to the distance of the middle star to the line, it is likely that this second value was of little consequence in the method he used to determine the alignments.</p>

<p id="p151">In Ptolemy’s case, the term <i>μικρόν</i>, when referring to the distance to the line between the two extreme stars, is frankly very vague. We find that it can vary from less than ½° in the cases of Taurus and Virgo, up to more than 2° in the case of Capricorn. In general, it indicates a fairly large distance when compared to the alleged “straight lines” we saw before. </p>

<p id="p152">The last three cases are dissimilar. While the case in Gemini fits with the average error in Hipparchus, the case in Libra is very close to a perfect alignment: it could have been described by Ptolemy as a “straight line”. The case in Cancer is a special one. As we saw earlier, while the text clearly indicates Procyon as one of the extremes, the error is so big, and so out of tune with the average error, that the Sirius option (174.81° and 49.89´) should not be discarded.</p>

<p id="p153">These considerations about the errors in both astronomers may point to the question about observational methods: what kind of instrument were Hipparchus and Ptolemy using when determining these alignments? One could even ask if they were using the same. Pedersen (2010: 237) suggests that they used a tout string to determine the alignments. Evans (1998: 249) argues against this possibility, correctly indicating that it is very difficult to focus one’s view on the string and the stars at the same time, and that “One can actually do much better with the unassisted eye than with the aid of a handheld string.” During a recent trip to a location with unpolluted skies, I carried out a simple experiment and asked some laymen to find several sets of three stars that they considered to be on a straight line. I then checked their choices and found that the errors very much coincided with the margin of error which our astronomers’ alignments showed for “straight lines”. The errors in alignments determined by me also fit into this general range. This is, of course, just an informal study, and a more methodical survey might be carried out in the future to determine more precisely how accurately the unaided eye determines great circles in the sky.</p>

<h2>Hipparchus’ influence on Ptolemy: some interesting comparisons.</h2>

<p id="p154" class="textindent0">Did Ptolemy use Hipparchus’ configurations in the determination of his own, original ones? Regarding the type of configurations, it is obvious that he was inspired by Hipparchus, or by the subset of Hipparchian configurations he chose to quote. We only find in the Ptolemaic ones cases of straight lines, quasi-straight lines, bisections of one line by another, or an isosceles triangle. In the Hipparchian list we already find examples of these types. So there is no originality in this regard on Ptolemy’s part.</p>

<p id="p155">Regarding the star selection, only about 35% of the stars Ptolemy uses were also used by Hipparchus. The five brightest stars used by Hipparchus are also among the stars used by Ptolemy: Arcturus, Procyon, <span lang="grc">α</span> Tau, Spica and <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem. Only the last three were used by Ptolemy as reference stars (Pedersen, 2010: 236) in other parts of the <i>Almagest</i>. As was pointed out earlier, though, given his aims it is only natural that he used as many bright stars as he could in his alignments. There are other instances, though, where Ptolemy reused fainter stars, such as <span lang="grc">β</span> Psc, which is almost the faintest used by Ptolemy. A comparison between the alignments in Hipparchus and Ptolemy explains why Ptolemy reused it.</p>

</figure>

<p id="p156">Refer to <a href="#illustration42">Illustration 42</a>. It is clear from the comparison that Ptolemy likely determined his own as a mere extension of the Hipparchian alignment he was checking. Under closer examination, other Ptolemaic examples seem plausibly to have originated during Ptolemy’s study on Hipparchus’ alignments.</p>

<p id="p157">Refer to <a href="#illustration43">Illustration 43</a>. Ptolemy’s alignment in Gemini indicates that a certain star is in the same line as <span lang="grc">α</span> and <span lang="grc">β</span> Gem. This is parallel to Hipparchus’ first alignment in Gemini, which does the same. Again, Ptolemy’s example seems to be an extension of Hipparchus’.</p>

<img alt="" src="images/illustration43.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration42"/>43. Comparison between the Hipparchian (red) and Ptolemaic (blue, two possibilities) alignments in Gemini.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p158">The following comparison, even if it does not indicate a Hipparchian inspiration, does support the idea that Ptolemy had originally referred to Sirius instead of Procyon in his second alignment in Cancer. Refer to <a href="#illustration44">Illustration 44</a>.</p>

<figure id="illustration44">
<img alt="" src="images/illustration44.png"/>
<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration43"/>44. Comparison between the Hipparchian (left) and Ptolemaic (right) alignments in Cancer and Procyon/Sirius.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p159">In red, we can see that Hipparchus determined that <span lang="grc">α</span> Cnc and <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc were almost in the same line with Procyon. If Ptolemy, with good reasons, judged this alignment to be accurate, why would he then say that it is <span lang="grc">δ</span> Cnc the star in Cancer that aligned with <span lang="grc">β</span> Cnc and Procyon?</p>

<p id="p160">Ptolemy’s study of Hipparchus’ alignments in Virgo also seem to have served of inspiration. Refer to <a href="#illustration45">Illustration 45</a>.</p>

<figure id="illustration45">

<figcaption>Illustration <a id="refIllustration44"/>45. Comparison between the Hipparchian (red) and Ptolemaic (blue) alignments in Virgo and Hydra’s tail.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p id="p161">As before, the Ptolemaic alignment is nothing more than an extension of the one Hipparchus had left, and which Ptolemy says he checked.</p>

<p id="p162">Finally, and although it is not obvious, it is possible that a similar case can be found in Libra. Refer to <a href="#illustration46">Illustration 46</a>. It is possible that Ptolemy noticed the β Lib-α Lib-π Hya alignment while checking Hipparchus’ <span lang="grc">α</span> Lib-β Lib-<span lang="grc">μ</span> Ser alignment.</p>

<p id="p163">The subject of this paper has been deliberately kept exclusively focused on the analysis of the configurations themselves, and the relations I could find between them. However, there are several questions which are central to this section of the <i>Almagest</i> and which deserve new research: what was the method, if there was any, to determine the alignments given here, or the angular distances involved in the descriptions provided by the text? How are the descriptions given in this section related to the star catalog in the <i>Almagest</i>? What was the fate of the list of configurations within the Hellenistic and Islamic astronomical communities?</p>

<p id="p164">I hope that this paper will serve as a stepping-stone on which future research can be built upon.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-1">1</a></sup> It could be argued that it is arbitrary to measure the distance of the middle star to the line determined by the extremes, instead of measuring the distance of one of the extremes to the line determined by the other two. The only reason I have to decide for the former option is that, in the cases when the <i>Almagest</i> gives any indication of the distance of a star to a line, it gives the distance of the middle one. In my opinion, this says something about the method used by them to measure the alignments, even if it is true that there is no certainty about it. Given that the calculations were done on a computer, it would be easy to give <i>all</i> the values for the deviations in every case. However, this would make the text even more cumbersome than it already is.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-6"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-6">6</a></sup> The magnitudes are 3.39 for ζ Peg and 4.31 for ξ Peg, meaning that the first was 2.3 times brighter than the second. The <i>Almagest</i>’s catalog also (crudely) indicates this relation with magnitudes 3 and 4, respectively.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-8"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-8">8</a></sup> According to the Hipparcos mission data, it has an annual proper motion of 1151.61 milliarcseconds in right ascension, and of -246.32 in declination.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-9"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-9">9</a></sup> This alignment is one of the few Evans refers to in his <i>History and Practice</i> (Evans, 1998: 249), and gives the same distance I obtained.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-10"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-10">10</a></sup> Evans (1998: 249) also points out that this is a poor alignment, with an error of “[…] more than a degree.”</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-11"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-11">11</a></sup> Besides the mention in the star catalog, he uses it as the reference for the construction of the solid globe (Toomer, 1984: 405).</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-12"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-12">12</a></sup> Evans (1998, 249) emphasizes that “This seems to be the only one of Ptolemy’s alignments that can be used today to reveal a proper motion”, correctly indicating that today Arcturus is notably farther from the line than in Ptolemy’s times (46.17´ by my calculations). As Evans says, it is precisely Arcturus’ high proper motion (an annual motion -1093.45 milliarcseconds in RA, and -1999.4 milliarcseconds in declination, according to the <i>Hipparcos</i> mission data). However, the angle at Arcturus is 177.93°. Both the angle and the distance to the line are well within Ptolemy’s margin of error: one should only look to the next one to find similar errors in a similarly large alignment.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-13"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-13">13</a></sup> See the first Hipparchian configuration for Sagittarius.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-14"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-14">14</a></sup> Cf (Toomer, 1984: 138 and 328) for instances of Hipparchus dating observations using this reference. For a more general discussion of Kallippic dates, see <a title="(Jones, 2000)">(Jones, 2000)</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-15"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-15">15</a></sup> As I said in the beginning, the <i>Almagest</i> describes 26 configurations. In a couple of cases though, the same set of stars is used for two different configurations.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-16"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-16">16</a></sup> The earliest observation in the <i>Almagest</i> that involves a reference star is from -294 (Toomer, 1984: 337). Thus, from Ptolemy’s point of view, the interval to his own time is not so great that a possible proper motion would affect its usefulness.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-17"><sup><a href="#footnote-reference-17">17</a></sup> In this analysis and the ones that follow, I have mostly assumed Toomer’s identifications of the stars, and preferred my own only when it seemed secure to do so. Given the number of alignments we have received, the results are very much the same regardless of what options I chose.</p>
